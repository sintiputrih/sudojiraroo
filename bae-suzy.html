Scroll below and check more detailed information about Current Net worth as well as Monthly/Year Salary, Expenses, Income Reports!</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p><strong>Bae Suzy was born on October 10, 1994, in Buk District, Gwangju, South Korea.</strong> She is the younger sister of Bae Wan-young and Jeong Hyun-sook. Suzy has a younger brother, Bae Sang-moon, and an older sister, Bae Su-bin. She has a 26-year-old daughter.</p><p>Suzy was captivated by the art of music from a young age. She had known since then that she wanted to work in the industry. In this regard, she stated her desire to attend an art school rather than a regular school. Her loving parents were completely behind her, and she soon enrolled at the School of Performing Arts Seoul. She received her diploma in 2013.</p><h2><span id=Bae_Suzy_Professional_Life_Career_and_achievement><span class="TextRun SCXW179985017 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW179985017 BCX8">Bae Suzy: Professional Life, Career</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW179985017 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'> and achievement</span></span></h2><p>Suzy began her career when she was only 15 years old. She used to work as a model for an online store. Meanwhile, she was looking for better opportunities. She then discovered Mnet Superstar K, a popular Korean talent show. She auditioned and advanced to the preliminary round before being eliminated. Her talent, however, caught the attention of JYP Entertainment, and she soon became a trainee. She eventually formed a girl group with fellow trainees Fei, Jia, and Min in 2010. They dubbed the group ‘Miss A.’</p><p>The group began their journey in China, where they recorded and performed a promotional song for Samsung Electronics. They made their official debut, however, with the song ‘Bad Girl Good Girl.’ Their debut was a huge success, and by the end of the year, they’d released another single, ‘Breath.’ They released their first album, titled ‘Class A,’ in 2011.</p><p>Suzy ventured into acting in addition to her successful musical career. She made her debut on KBS in the music teen drama Dream High, which aired from January 3 to February 28. She won the Best New Actress award as well as the Best Couple award with co-star Kim Soo-Hyun for her outstanding performance in the drama.</p><p>Suzy appeared in the 2012 film Architecture 101 after appearing in the Drama series. The film was one of the most popular in Korea, setting a new box-office record. Suzy co-starred in the historical fusion drama Gu Family Book with Lee Seung-gi in 2013. Her performance in the drama was recognized at the MBC Drama Awards, where she received the Top Excellence award, and at the Seoul International Drama Awards, where she received the Outstanding Actress award. As a result, she was featured as the Healing Camp’s youngest guest ever.</p><p>Aside from that, she played Jin Chae-sun, Korea’s first female pansori singer, in the 2014 film The Sound of Flower. Her other works include the melodrama romance Uncontrollably Fond and the fantasy thriller drama While You Were Sleeping.</p><h2><span id=Collaboration_and_solo_work>Collaboration and solo work</span></h2><p>Suzy was unable to keep up with Miss A because she was preoccupied with her personal matters. Later that year, with the album Yes? No? she made her solo debut. However, the band was only disbanded in late 2017. In 2018, she returned to singing with the release of her second album, Faces of Love.</p><p>Suzy has previously collaborated with other popular artists such as Exo’s Baekhyun. Their single Dream was even nominated for “Best Collaboration” at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. She also collaborated with singer Park Won on a duet. Suzy signed a contract with the acting agency Management SOOP on March 31, 2019, after her contract with JYP expired.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_and_Awards>Net Worth and Awards</span></h2><p>Suzy is without a doubt the best at what she does. Her career has been illustrious and inspiring, with numerous accomplishments. It is difficult to list all of the awards she has received. Suzy is the first Korean female celebrity to win a singer rookie award, a drama rookie award, and a film rookie award, having won the Best New Actress award at the 48th Baeksang Arts Awards for her performance in Architecture 101. She also took home the Top Excellence Award at the 2017 SBS Drama Awards.</p><p>She is also the first Korean female celebrity to have a wax figure of herself created by Madame Tussauds. In September of 2016, the wax figure was on display.</p><p>Suzy is one of the wealthiest K-pop Idols. She is ranked 13th on the list. Suzy’s primary source of income comes from her acting and singing. She has, however, served as an endorsement model for several companies. In 2013, she earned more than $9 million in endorsement deals, according to sources. Her current net worth is estimated to be $20 million.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Bae Suzy&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

They were the most well-known couple in Korean cinema. However, after two years of dating, the couple divorced in 2017. Although they have not revealed the reason for the breakup, it is widely assumed that Min-mandatory ho’s military public service was a factor.</p><p>Suzy went on to have a romantic relationship with South Korean actor Lee Dong Wook after that. They, too, split up in less than a year.
