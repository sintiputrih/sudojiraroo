Most of his income comes from the success of the show.</p><p>However, he has not revealed exactly how much he makes from his television career and total assets.</p><h2>Brian Quinn Girlfriend And Dating History</h2><p>Although a viral character on television, Brian Quinn has managed to maintain his private life shallow. However, there is no detailed information associating with Quinn’s present or past relationship.</p><p>Brian is supposed to be single at the moment. Nevertheless, it looks like he is a married man.

Q was only in a relationship with one woman, <strong>Emily Amick</strong>. Emily was an ‘Impractical Jokers’ make-up artist and obviously worked with the casts.</p><p>With that, the two became closer and started dating. Further, the couple was seen together many times in public, and there were rumors that they were engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brian-and-Emily.jpg><p>Things went wrong with Q, though, when Emily had an affair with another guy. She later married the guy with whom she had the relationship. Q hasn’t been connected to any other female ever since. Even though Quinn tried to mask it with comedy, we can see that it deeply hurt him.</p><h2><strong>Brian Quinn Illness</strong></h2><p>While he was filming, the audience did not know about the fact that Q was suffering from severe illness. It is incredible how much the public does not know about their favorite celebrities. Everyone thought he was infected with some flu, but it was much worse than that.</p><p>However, after four physicians administered a battery of invasive exams, a hazardous antibiotic regimen, and a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease, physicians lastly discovered that Q had a severe illness called encephalitis and meningitis.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Impractical Jokers: Know The Net Worth of The Four Jokers >></a></h4><p>Encephalitis is acute brain swelling. Furthermore, most of these instances are caused by a viral infection or the immune system that erroneously attacks brain tissue.</p><p>Meningitis, on the other hand, is a rare disease that impacts about 100 individuals in a million in a year, affecting sensitive membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.</p><h2>Body Measurement</h2><p>Talking about his body measurement, Quinn stands at the height of 5 feet 10 inches, which is equivalent to 179 cm. As we can see, Q has an average physique, which is more towards the heavy side. But he seems to have improved his health a lot over the years.</p><p>Moreover, his hair and eyes color is dark brown. Not to mention, Quinn also has a fair skin complexion.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>: </strong>1.4 Million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Twitter:&nbsp;</strong></a>1 Million Followers</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook</a>: </strong>465k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57waugmqZdpsKqus1mnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdqbauscuipZ5llaK2rcWO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-bryan-harsin-daughter-and-what-did-she-say-about-her-fathers-affair-with-assistant-coach-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Bryan Harsin Daughter And What Did She Say About Her Fathers Affair With Assistant Coach?">&larr;
