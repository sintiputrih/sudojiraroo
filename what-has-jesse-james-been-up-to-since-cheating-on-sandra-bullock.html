The couple married in 2005 and divorced five years later, and being both important public figures, they weren't allowed too much privacy. Sandra was the one that probably suffered from having her marital problems broadcasted the most, since it was Jesse's infidelity that the media exploited the most, but thankfully the buzz has died down, and Jesse has since apologized extensively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Things We Forgot About The Beloved Sandra Bullock</a></span></p><p>Now, over a decade later, Jesse has moved on in his personal life and career. For those people who were wondering what has been of him since his divorce, these are some of the things he has been up to.</p><h2 id=he-had-his-own-discovery-channel-show><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Had His Own Discovery Channel Show</span></h2><p>In 2012, two years after officially ending his relationship with <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a>, Jesse James was offered the possibility of doing a show on the&nbsp;Discovery Channel about something he's really passionate about: building custom motorcycles. The show was called&nbsp;Outlaw Garage, and although it only lasted one season, he had a great time doing it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm so happy to be finally doing the show I want to do & doing it with one of my best friends in life Hildie Katibah," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse said about it</a>. "She has been a pilar in my life for the last 12 years producing Monster Garage and running Pay Up Sucker Productions. Her & I have made some amazing TV together but we know it's mostly her."</p><h2 id=he-had-a-relationship-with-kat-von-d><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Had A Relationship With Kat Von D</span></h2><p>Right after <a href=#>splitting with Sandra</a>, Jesse found love again. He started a very passionate and complicated relationship with famous tattoo artist, the amazing <a href=#>Kat Von D</a>. They stayed together for a little over a year, and even got engaged.&nbsp; They announced their engagement for the first time in 2011, but shortly after they called it off.&nbsp;For a while it seemed that they decided to give their engagement another chance, but then sadly it didn't work out. They split amicably in the end of 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-in-sons-of-guns><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Was In 'Sons Of Guns'</span></h2><p>It's no secret that Jesse is a gun enthusiast, so when he had the chance to make an appearance in&nbsp;<a href=#>Discovery Channel</a>'s show,&nbsp;Sons of Guns. The show is set in Lousiana, and it focuses on a business that sells custom firearms.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Sandra Bullock Has A Huge $250 Million Net Worth: Here’s How She Made Her Money</a></span></p><p>Their products are bought both by law enforcement officers and private collectors. This isn't the first time Jesse was invited to the show. He also appeared in an episode in 2009.</p><h2 id=he-started-a-handmade-firearms-business><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Started A Handmade Firearms Business</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years ago, Jesse decided to take his passion for guns to the next level. That's how he started his business,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jesse James</a> Firearms Unlimited, making custom firearms. He had some help learning the skills he needed, and almost eight years later, he couldn't be happier about the success he's been having.</p><p>"<span title=Editado>It's an understatement to say how incredibly lucky I have been to learn my skills from some of the best in many disciplines. In 2013 I decided I wanted to build my own 1911 pistols. I looked high and low for the right person to teach me the right way to do things," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse explained</a>. "I found Jim Garthwaite in Watsontown Pennsylvania. Boy did I make the right choice. Jim was the American Pistolsmith's Guild, Pistolsmith of the year in 2004. But even more importantly Jim showed me a very pragmatic/non secret sauce way of machining and building 1911's. That makes them very accurate and dependable. Techniques I will use forever."</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-had-a-granddaughter><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Had A Granddaughter</span></h2><p>One of the most important milestones in Jesse's life since his divorce was the birth of his granddaughter. In March last year he announced to his followers that his daughter Chandler was about to have a baby.</p><p>"Soooooo do you remember that little blonde girl from Motorcycle Mania???? You know the one that thought she was a way better skipper than me?? Well my little girl Chandler is 25 Now! Annnnd expecting a baby due next month. ANNND it's a Girl!!!! And I’m gonna be a grandpa," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse shared on Instagram</a>. "For real though I’m so proud of CJ. She is such a strong, kind, beautiful woman now. She's going to be an amazing mom. I can see it... Ok now you can go ahead and fill the comments with old man jokes..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-lost-a-dear-friend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Lost A Dear Friend</span></h2><p>It's never easy to lose a loved one, but it's even harder to watch them go down a road knowing it won't end well and being unable to stop them. Candace Muzny was an incredible NASCAR driver, and she also struggled with drug addiction. Jesse was very close with her and her death was a low blow, especially because he shared that he had done his best to help her overcome her problems. Addiction is a very serious disease, and recognizing that, Jesse finishes his post in which he says goodbye to Candace to encourage people to reach out for help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-received-some-difficult-news><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Received Some Difficult News</span></h2><p>The relationship a person has with the parent of their children never really goes away. When Jesse split up with his first wife, the two of them not only remained civil but they stayed close friends. Which made the terrible news Jesse shared with his fans even harder for him. Last year, Karla was diagnosed with&nbsp;early onset Alzheimers and dementia, and in his grief, Jesse reached out to his followers. He explained that he would be taking care of her, along with his kids, because she didn't have any other family, and asked people to send him any advice or resource they could share so he could learn to deal with the situation.</p><h2 id=he-shared-a-family-tradition><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Shared A Family Tradition</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something readers might not know is that Jesse takes his almond tart very seriously. It was a big moment for him when he taught his sixteen year-old daughter his "world-famous" recipe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Miss Congeniality: 10 Of Sandra Bullock's Highest-Paying Roles</a></span></p><p>He was very proud of her because she did an amazing job. Another important piece of information is that, if someone wants to recreate Jesse's secret recipe, he shared it with the world years ago on the Martha Stewart show. According to him, it can still be found in her website.</p><h2 id=he-owns-a-culinary-knives-business><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Owns A Culinary Knives Business</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jesse started <a href=#>Jesse James</a> Culinary in 2018. The business sells custom made culinary knives, and the line is as extensive as it is beautiful. While obviously the knives have a very clear use, the patterns and the production process make them pieces of art.</p><p>"Every knife here at Jesse James Culinary is made by hand," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reads their website</a>, where readers can check out the products. "We cut no corners and spare no detail."</p><h2 id=he-hosted-another-season-of-monster-garage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Hosted Another Season Of 'Monster Garage'</span></h2><p>Many years ago, in 2002, Jesse became the host of a show called&nbsp;Monster Garage, which showed a group of mechanics having to modify cars under a deadline.&nbsp;Monster Garage lasted until 2006, and it wasn't until last year that it started up again. With all the great memories Jesse has from that show, he was very excited to host it again. He even had the set blessed by a priest, because he wanted everything to go perfectly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Forgotten Facts About Matthew McConaughey And Sandra Bullock's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yjnKyrlWK3ornErGSbnZWjera8jK2mZquZo7CmecKhnJqsmaO0brvNZqqappSnrm6u1KWjqJubZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-bin-ladens-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are Bin Laden's parents?">&larr;
