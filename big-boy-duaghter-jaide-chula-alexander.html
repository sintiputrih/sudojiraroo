The Chicago native previously hosted the morning show at Los Angeles Rhythmic contemporary station KPWR (Power 106). Since 2015, he has been working at REAL 92.3. During his long career, he has gained immense fame and fortune.</p><p>Talking about his personal life, the radio personality has been married to&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Veronica Alexander</strong></a> for nearly two decades. They have created a lovely family of four during their marital journey, including two adorable babies. Both of them have already grown up. Thus, in today’s article, let’s get to know Big Boy’s daughter, <strong>Jaide Chula Alexander,&nbsp;</strong>including her interests and career goal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_The_Youngest_Kid></span>Is The Youngest Kid<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jaide Chula was born on 24 September 2008 to her father and mother. She also has a handsome elder brother,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jay Money Alexander</a>&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Jayden Alexander, </strong>who was born on 02 February 2007. In addition, the brother-sister duo must share a close bond. Considering how they don’t have much age gap, the siblings must have grown up being playmates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Big-Boy-with-his-kids.jpg><p>Moreover, Big Boy is a devoted family guy who prioritizes his spouse and kids. He even got praised by <strong>Jack Harlow</strong>, an American rapper for being a great father. At that time, the radio personality became emotional and held back his tears. Big Boy’s daughter and son are indeed one of the luckiest kids to be born in such a supportive household.</p><p>Furthermore, Jaide’s elder sibling is into sports and is highly involved in Sierra Canyon High School‘s basketball team. He has been competing since a young age. In addition, Big Boy’s son shot an advertisement for Slaucienega alongside him.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>More About Martin St. Louis’ Son, Mason St. Louis, Who Is Following In The Family Footsteps</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_A_Student_At_Sierra_Canyon></span>Is A Student At Sierra Canyon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The radio host’s baby girl attends Sierra Canyon High School (SC). Recently, she completed her middle school education. The beautiful girl also seems to be a cheerful and outgoing person. She often posts photos of her hanging out with her friends on her Instagram account. Also, she is active on TikTok, where she posts frequently.</p><p>Besides, Jaide has not shared much about her interests on social media. As the child of such a famous individual in the entertainment industry, Jaide might follow in her father’s footsteps. However, even if she chooses to pursue her career in a different field, her parents and elder sibling will support her wholeheartedly.</p><p>Additionally, Jaide and her family live a lavish lifestyle, all thanks to her father’s wealth. As per Celebrity Net Worth, the radio host has a massive fortune of $8 million, including a $3.5 million salary per year. On the other hand, the beautiful girl has also gained significant attention from the media and has a considerable fan following on her IG account. Thus, she might have received several offers to promote various brands and products. As a result, Jaide Chula Alexander’s net worth must be a substantial sum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Big_Boys_Daughter_Is_Creative></span>Big Boy’s Daughter Is Creative<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the title suggests, the radio host’s only little girl is quite creative. She customized a T-shirt to celebrate Earth Day at her school. Big Boy proudly shared a picture of his lovely daughter’s work, calling it great on his social media.</p><p>Moreover, the Alexander family makes frequent public appearances. For instance, Big Boy’s wife and kids attended a ceremony honoring him with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September 2021. The family looked perfect. Talking about Jaide’s love life, well she seems to be more focused on her education.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Big Boy’s daughter has grown up to be a beautiful girl. The Alexander couple is very proud of their little girl, as evidenced by their constant IG posts. Hopefully, Jaide Chula Alexander will smoothly continue her education and pursue a career in whatever her heart desires. We wish to learn more about her in the coming days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Name_Meaning_Jaide_Chula></span>Name Meaning: Jaide Chula<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Arabic name Jaide means Goodness.
