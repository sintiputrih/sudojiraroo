Fans brought Tony and his family — Carmela Soprano (<strong>Edie Falco</strong>), and two kids Meadow (<strong>Jamie-Lynn Sigler</strong>) and A.J. (<strong>Robert Iler</strong>) — into their lives on a weekly basis until the controversial series finale aired in 2007.</p><p>As Tony conducted his business dealings throughout the tri-state area, viewers met a few side characters who were played by some familiar faces, albeit they weren’t notable names at the time.</p><p><strong>Lady Gaga</strong> made her acting debut during a 2001 episode of The Sopranos as one of A.J.’s school friends (or as she was officially credited, Girl at Swimming Pool No. 2).</p><p>“When I look back on that scene I can see exactly what I did wrong in that scene,” Gaga told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a> in December 2021. “I didn’t know how to listen in a scene! I was supposed to laugh, and it was sort of like, cue, laugh … I see it and I go, ‘oh, that’s not a real laugh!'”</p><p>Gaga called herself a “non-specific actor” on The Sopranos, but has since developed her acting skills. Aside from being a successful musician, Gaga has since nabbed roles in movies like A Star Is Born and The House of Gucci.</p><p><strong>Will Arnett</strong> also had a guest spot on the show. He joked that he wished “everybody would forget about” what he looked like when portraying an FBI agent in the series, during a 2019 appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Late Late Show With James Corden</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see who else had a surprise guest-starring appearance in The Sopranos:</p><h3>Mike Epps</h3><p>Epps starred as Jerome in season 1, episode 2, titled “46 Long,” of The Sopranos.</p><h3>Michael B.
