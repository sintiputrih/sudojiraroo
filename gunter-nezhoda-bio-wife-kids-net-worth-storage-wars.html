According to TMZ, Gunther’s son Rene announced his death Tuesday night in his sleep in Utah as a consequence of complications from lung cancer in an emotional remembrance message.</p><p>Gunter was diagnosed with cancer in September 2022, and the chemotherapy he received had negative effects. Rene said his dad’s lungs had holes in them due to the treatment, so Gunter had flown to Utah recently in order to undergo emergency surgery. However, Rene claimed that doctors told his father it was too late and there was “nothing else they could do.”</p><p>Rene uploaded an emotional video on Instagram Wednesday in which he broke the news of his dad’s death and captioned it, “Very Sad day for the #storagewars #family #RIP #GunterNezhoda.” “My dad six months ago was diagnosed with lung cancer — he’s been smoking for 30 years,” he said in the clip. “He’s been smoking for a long time.”</p><p>“He was one of the guys on Storage Wars who never really got any hate,” Rene explained. “Everyone loved working with my dad.” At the time of his death, he was beside his youngest son Ricky Nezhoda. Rene noted that his family kept Gunter’s cancer battle private because they thought that he would “fully recover” but “unfortunately he didn’t.”</p><p>Gunter concluded, “All the love that you guys have shown and support, he really appreciates that, and now hopefully he’s now up there in heaven with my mom dancing again.”</p><p>Gunter appeared on a total of seven episodes of Storage Wars from 2015 to 2019 and according to sources he taped an episode with Rene for the future season.</p><h3><strong>Did Gunter Nezhoda Leave Behind A Wife?</strong></h3><p>No, Gunter Nezhoda didn’t leave behind a wife.

Together with his wife, Rene joined the cast of the “Storage Wars” television show on the A&E network, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Rene is married to Casey, who appeared on the A&E network series with him. The couple is known to as “The Bargain Hunters” on the show and complimented each other fairly nicely.</p><p>Ricky Nezhoda is the youngest son of Gunter. He is currently 38 years old and is currently engaged to his fiance Elise. Ricky was by his father’s side at the last moment.
