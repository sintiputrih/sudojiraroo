Relationship expert Louella Alderson, co-founder of dating app, Sp Syncd, has shared her thoughts with HELLO! about the emotional impact the transition will have on both Chrissy - who has an incredibly close relationship with her mom, as well as her four young children, who have grown up with Pepper playing a vital role in their lives.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f0a2663e5b6-snapinstaapp40394550310294872115002854623778673695360995n1080.jpg><p id=eDyVgQtjax data-wc=43>"Moving can have a significant impact on families, especially when a parent or other close family member leaves to live in another country. The impact can be both emotional and practical, and it can affect each family member in different ways," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJCHSs6jUo data-wc=22>Of course, there are many positives too, with Chrissy having already revealed that the family plan to visit Pepper every Spring Break.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a2cea48240a-snapinstaapp36002993213393982199452494074474174563032207n1080.jpg><p id=eyGqkOLbVh data-wc=92>"For Chrissy, Pepper moving back to Thailand could also be seen as an opportunity for her and John to experience life without the ease of having her mum on hand to help out with everything. While it could be a challenge at first, it could also be a chance for them to grow as parents and strengthen their family unit. The distance may even bring them closer together as they learn to appreciate each other more and make the most of the time they have together when they visit Pepper," Louella said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eo3uLSshVY data-wc=37>"Visiting Thailand will also be a good opportunity for their children to learn about their heritage, different cultures, and ways of life.
