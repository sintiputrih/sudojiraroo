"It's so easy to dress all of them-you're just standing in front of the racks and something jumps out at you, like, 'That's a fabulous color for Cynthia; that's so Charlotte,'" says Rogers.

But what about Carrie? "We tried to have her wear a hat in the tent scene," says Rogers, "But it was white rabbit fur and we just couldn't justify wearing fur in the desert, so we just left it on the blanket as a prop."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charlotte: Vintage Halston dress, Chanel collar, Rodrigo Otazu bracelet and Christian Louboutin shoes (on blanket).<br>Carrie: Vintage Halston dress, Stella McCartney tank, Reem Acra belt, Cocotay cuffs, Bea Valdes bag and Manolo Blahnik heels (both on blanket).<br>Samantha: Patricia Field for Keith Haring dress, Patricia Field mules, Wendy Brandes earrings.<br>Miranda: Mara Hoffman dress, Roberto Cavalli bracelet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-its-like-theyre-the-supremes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"It's like they're the Supremes…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>New Line Cinema</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest thrill for the designers was shooting the fashionable foursome away from Manhattan-and making them harmonize. "I think the whole idea of this trip was like a symphony or concerto with the other three and Carrie together," says Field. "It's like a girl group-it's like they're the Supremes!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miranda: Vintage jumpsuit, Samantha Wills earrings and Ralph Lauren shoes.<br>Carrie: Halston Heritage dress, Low Luv bracelet, vintage turban and Manolo Blahnik shoes.<br>Samantha: Ralph Lauren.<br>Charlotte: Vintage dress, Julien David scarf, Chanel belt, Miu Miu shoes, Patricia Underwood hat and Cartier bracelets.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-that-was-a-real-last-minute-deal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"That was a real last-minute deal…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Craig Blankenhorn / New Line Cinema</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An 11th-hour visit to underground designers, The Blonds, took this scene in a radical new direction. "That was a real last-minute deal," Rogers says of the looks. "Pat's original idea was to have them all in long dresses like a girl singing group." Instead, Samantha's studded dress and Carrie's jeans were hastily (and stunningly!) added to the mix.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miranda: Vintage Halston dress, vintage belt.<br>Carrie: Chanel skirt over Closed jeans (customized with crystals by The Blonds), Stella McCartney blouse, vintage headpiece.<br>Samantha: The Blonds dress, vintage belt, Nicole Romano earrings and Le Vive ring.Charlotte: Vintage YSL dress, Blu by Betty Lou Moscot earrings and Jack Vartanian bracelet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-had-the-hat-custom-made></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We had the hat custom made…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Craig Blankenhorn / New Line Cinema</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The inspiration for Samantha's headdress came straight from N.Y.C.'s Lower East Side. "In the '80s I remember Pat wearing this hat," Rogers said of the perforated headdress. "I was like, 'Pat, you just have to pick the color of leather' and we had the hat custom made." The topper was recreated by its original milliner. "At first we were loving it for Kristin, we were thinking a Cleopatra feel for her," she says, but it was the ultimately the fearless Kim Cattrall who rocked the hat. "It's very Lawrence of Arabia."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha: American Apparel bathing suit, Jean Paul Gaultier dress, Ivana Sert shrug, Ralph Lauren bag and custom Horst NYC hat.<br>Charlotte: Alexander Wang tank, Zac Posen pants, Patricia Field robe and a Vivienne Westwood hat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-styled-ourselves-for-four-hours></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We styled ourselves for four hours…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Craig Blankenhorn / New Line Cinema</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The luxe looks on camel-bound Carrie and Miranda were inspired by a long-ago trip to Egypt taken by the two costume designers. "It's exciting to go together to a place," Rogers says. "When we went to Egypt, we styled ourselves for four hours for the camels. You get into romance of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Dior bustier, Ralph Lauren trousers, Zara blouse, YSL shoes, Philip Treacy turban, Low Luv cuff and Hermes bag.<br>Miranda: Hermes shirtdress and cowboy hat, Missoni pants, Roberto Cavalli belt and Salvatore Ferragamo sandals.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-toyed-with-lots-of-different></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We toyed with lots of different…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>RAM / Fame Pictures</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Flashdance</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">was the starting point for Carrie's first flashback outfit, along with Rogers' own '80s wardrobe. "All of us had plastic see-through bags," she says of working at Patricia Field's Lower East Side shop. "I got mine out of storage." But the biggest sticking point was the (flat!) shoes. "I'm sure it was extremely difficult for amp#91;SJPamp#93;," jokes Rogers. "We toyed with lots of different shoes, Doc Martens and things like that, but we thought it was classic Americana to be in a sneaker."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Vintage sweatshirt, Jordache jeans, vintage luggage and Converse sneakers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-went-with-a-desperately></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We went with a Desperately…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>RODRIGO & LUIS JR.

"At the end of all Sarah Jessica's fittings we would take a minute and talk about flashbacks," says Rogers. "We went with a Desperately Seeking Susan look." The bulk of her outfit came from the Betsey Johnson archives. "Sarah Jessica added the pearls and rubber bracelets."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Laura Ashley dress, Betsey Johnson corset, vintage Amy Barr shirt, Chantelle bra, Brian Atwood shoes and vintage jewelry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-went-with-a-rocker-look></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We went with a rocker look…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha's style was inspired by legendary music club, CBCG. "We went with a rocker look, punk rocker, in a way," recalls Rogers. "The idea just kind of came into the room." The outfit was a combination of vintage and accessories from Patricia Field's own store. "It took us a long time to find the right jean jacket."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha: Levi's vest, Natasha shirt, Michi pants, Fantasy boots and House of Field clutch.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charlotte-was-a-no-brainer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"Charlotte was a no-brainer…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was the classic sorority sister," Rogers says of Charlotte and her preppie style. "Charlotte was a no-brainer-Add-a-Beads and all of that, Tretorn sneakers." Along with a pink-and-white getup, the character carried a hairbrush and a wooden-handled interchangeable bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charlotte: Lilly Pulitzer sweater and skirt, Strenesse blouse, Tretorn shoes and vintage purse.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-went-straight-to-the-thrift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"We went straight to the thrift…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Richie Buxo / Splash News</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Law student Miranda Hobbes got the full up-and-coming career girl treatment. "We wanted a suit with those shoulders and Reeboks and ankle socks," Rogers says. "It was a thrift store suit. We went straight to the thrift store in Queens. It was like, 'What suit do you want?' We probably got four bags of suits for $20."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miranda: Vintage suit, Nordstrom blouse, Reebok shoes, vintage Barnes and Noble tote.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-would-go-through-the-racks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"She would go through the racks…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Craig Blankenhorn / New Line Cinema</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sarah Jessica Parker was very hands on when it came to putting together her character's unforgettable looks. "She would go through the racks and do Kiss or Kill," says Rogers, explaining, "Like it and it stays or you kindly kill it. She's a very fast edit. She can whittle down 20 racks in no time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Emilio Pucci dress, Zac Posen belt, Marc Walsh/Leslie Chin for Rodarte cuff and Chanel bag.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-it-feels-really-right></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"It feels really right…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Team NYC/InterTOPICS /Retna Ltd</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I believe that was our first day out," Rogers says of Carrie's already iconic outfit (as seen in the movie's posters!). "When I see her coming out of that building it feels really right." The duo added glittering accessories to a simple white jersey dress. "It's clean and sophisticated and that Solange necklace is the little twist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Halston Heritage dress, Christian Louboutin shoes, Mykita sunglasses, Solange Azagury-Partridge necklace and Chanel clutch.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-sweatband-was-a-crew-gift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"The sweatband was a crew gift…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Pat changed that outfit the day we were shooting it," Rogers says of Carrie's casual look. "She felt like it was a summer day and we haven't seen Carrie just kicking around town and not all dolled up and done." Along with stunning studded Brian Atwood pumps, Carrie sported a few more down-to-earth accessories. "The sweatband was a crew gift" from the producers ("I guess they knew we would be sweating") and the tote came from N.Y.C.'s Highline park.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Closed jeans, Patricia Field shirt, Brian Atwood shoes and a Highline tote.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-it-is-just-alive-and-on-fire></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"It is just alive and on fire…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The designers went all the way to Paris to find a new signature necklace for Carrie. "It is just alive and on fire with diamonds," Rogers says of the Chahan Minassian piece. "We thought that was incredible to get that on her, because the shamrock stands for luck." Not only did they swap out the silver chain for a gold one, but the duo used the necklace as a bracelet in another scene.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie: Halston Heritage dress, Christian Louboutin shoes and bag, Jimmy Choo cuff and Chahan Minassian clover necklace.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-it-was-the-first-fancy-dress-that></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>"It was the first fancy dress that…"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Diane Cohen/ Fame Pictures</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a scene set at Carrie's old apartment, her Dior newsprint dress made a comeback.
