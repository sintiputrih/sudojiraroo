Being an A-list star may sound like a dream for some, but it isn't always easy for these celebs, who want to live somewhat of a normal lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Best Celebrity Spokespeople For Luxury Brands</a></span></p><p>To keep their lives more private and away from the public eye, numerous stars refuse<a href=#>&nbsp;to do talk shows and interviews</a>. We all know that talk show hosts want to know the latest news about a star and will press them for answers about their private lives. While the Kardashian family may love the spotlight, there are celebs like the Olsen twins and even Beyonce herself, who would rather talk to her fans herself than have a journalist or talk show host paint a different picture of her.</p><h2 id=the-olsen-twins><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Olsen Twins</span></h2><p>Twin sisters Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen have kept a low profile for a few years now. These two hardworking fashion designers have a reason why they turn away from talk shows and the spotlight with their younger sisters, actress <a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen explaining that many news outlets take celeb quotes out of content</a> all the time and they are not fans of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Ways The Olsen Twins Continue To Win Our Hearts</a></p><p>While talking to&nbsp;Modern Luxury,&nbsp;the actress stated, "I was not caring what I would say [in interviews] because I'd assume no-one would read it. That's when we'd have conversations. [Mary-Kate and Ashley] would say, 'You know, even if you don't think anyone's going to read this article, someone might pull the quote later for [something else.]'" Olsen added that her two sisters are "very tight-lipped."</p><h2 id=beyonce><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Beyonce</span></h2><p>Compared to many other A-list singers, <a href=#>Beyonce refuses to do talk shows and would rather submit her own personal essays</a> or messages to her fans herself. According to&nbsp;Elle,&nbsp;after Beyonce released her self-titled album in 2013, she stopped giving interviews to "conventional media outlets."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the songstress has been on a bunch of covers for magazines, she opts for writing the stories herself. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue writer Margo Jefferson shared that Beyonce</a>, "has to be studying how effective her interviews have been so far. They may have decided that they do not contribute as dazzlingly to the portrait of Beyonce than the other stuff." This may explain why we don't see the star on many talk shows.</p><h2 id=the-weeknd><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Weeknd</span></h2><p>When The Weeknd was somewhat new to the music scene, he avoided talk shows and interviews because he admitted he had insecurities. Confessing to&nbsp;Rolling Stone,&nbsp;the star shared, "I was everything an R&B singer wasn't. I wasn't in shape. I wasn't a pretty boy. I was awkward ... I still have this insecurity when I'm talking to someone educated." Of course, many of his <a href=#>fans seem him as a sweetheart</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Selena Gomez Has Done Since Her Breakup With The Weeknd</a></span></p><p>The Weeknd still seems to keep a low profile and his life private compared to other big named stars. He hasn't been on many talk shows for quite some time and according to&nbsp;Elle,&nbsp;only grants interviews through magazine profiles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-moss><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kate Moss</span></h2><p>Model Kate Moss learned from experience that the<a href=#> media can be cruel</a> and for some time, stepped away from giving interviews or going on any talk shows. Moss did not want to open up to news outlets so that they would eventually turn things around and face criticism.</p><p>"I just didn't like it. When I first started I did press because I wasn't really aware that they would write something really [negative] but then they did, and I was like, 'Oh, no, I don't want to go back there. I don't really want to open myself up to that kind of criticism,'" Moss shared with&nbsp;T&nbsp;magazine.</p><h2 id=kristen-stewart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kristen Stewart</span></h2><p>Kristen Stewart has openly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted that she's an awkward person</a>, telling&nbsp;Marie Claire magazine in 2014, "I have an embarrassing, inability, seriously, of summoning fake energy... I'm just not very good on TV, and it's not my main goal in life to get good at it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Kristen Stewart Meet Her Girlfriend, Dylan Meyer?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stewart has even stated that she wished she could <a href=#>continue making movies</a> without all the fame and dislikes being famous. She rarely does talk shows and interviews, and just wants to do her job. "I [dislike] the interview process. I do my work the same as you, why do I have to talk about it? I just want to be an actor," she revealed.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>At the start of her music career, Taylor Swift was all over covers of magazines, giving interviews, and talking about her latest albums. However, it appears that <a href=#>the star is taking Beyonce's advice and laying low</a> when it comes to doing interviews or appearing on talk shows.</p><p>Swift did not promote her 2017 album&nbsp;Reputation once when it was going to be released and explained to Apple Music, "At the very beginning of the album I was pretty proud of coining the term, 'there will be no explanation, there will just be&nbsp;Reputation.' And so that was what I decided was going to be the album. And I stuck with it," she declared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frank-ocean><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Frank Ocean</span></h2><p>Frank Ocean has never been the musician who constantly wants the spotlight. In fact, Ocean hardly gives interviews and he's barely on talk shows or television. There have even been articles written about <a href=#>Ocean and his whereabout</a>s since his 2016 album&nbsp;Blonde.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;Elle,&nbsp;Ocean would rather let his music speak than do interviews. He even told&nbsp;GQ when asked about why he<a href=#> tends to stay out of the spotlight</a> that he "could potentially be misrepresented."</p><h2 id=joaquin-phoenix><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Joaquin Phoenix</span></h2><p>Actor <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix is known for playing dark characters</a>, like in the latest movie&nbsp;Joker,&nbsp;where he plays the deranged killer clown and failed comedian Arthur Fleck. He is also known for his shy personality and it shows during his interviews, which he rarely does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson Cooper got a chance to interview Phoenix</a> and he found the actor shy, reserved, and was not even sure if he wanted to talk to him at all. When Cooper asked Phoenix if he liked being interviewed, the actor stated, "It's alright. But it's not something, - if I had, like, the choice of like, four different activities, I don't think it'd be one that I would choose."</p><h2 id=j-cole><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>J.Cole</span></h2><p>According to The Talko, J.Cole refused to do any press between the years of 2014 and 2018. The "Middle Child" rapper revealed that he did not find the interview process "genuine" and told Billboard he was "through trying to play whatever game is going on."</p><p><a href=#>It appears he also feels the same way about social media</a>, explaining that he rarely comments on his platforms. "If I'm in a conversation with somebody and it's natural and it's organic, I'm going to speak freely," he told&nbsp;Billboard, adding, "But rarely do I feel the need to hop on Twitter or social media to chime in, especially on rap and music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shia-labeouf><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shia LaBeouf</span></h2><p>Shia Labeouf is known for his weird outbursts and actions, including the time he wore a <a href=#>paper bag over his head in 2014</a> when walking the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival that read, "I am not famous anymore."</p><p>Since then, Labeouf has been arrested a couple of times, sat in silence for an hour with a&nbsp;Dazed&nbsp;magazine writer with GoPros on each other's heads, and spent 24 hours in an elevator as performance art. With all his outbursts, one of LaBeouf's last talk show interviews was on&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;in 2018, where he appeared a little too candid.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Kelly Clarkson Is Likely To Dethrone Ellen DeGeneres' Talk Show In Ratings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6s7HFrqqeZaSkeqW7jK2YpaNdqLWww9Jo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thogden.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bio, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Nationality, Facts">&larr;
