As these Mad Men fashion shots show, that investment paid off.</h2><p class=dropcaps>The story of the 1960s may be best told by recounting moments of social and political upheaval, but at an aesthetic level, the decade can also be defined by its fashion. While wars raged and political parties fragmented, 1960s fashion soared through a golden age. Rising wages increased demand for clothing and high fashion — and the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Men</a>” and women who donned them while drinking and smoking at work are a testament to that:</p><img alt="Mad Men Fashion Jackie Kennedy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mad-Men-fashion-Jackie-Kennedy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>The decade’s first fashion icon was first lady Jackie Kennedy.

Her pixie hairdo, little black dress, and movie star sunglasses were a staple in any woman’s wardrobe.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Wikipedia</a></span> <img alt="Nylon Flower" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nylon-flower.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Left: With clothes of this time boasting the idea that quality won out over quantity, it was a given that clothing was constructed to last. Even the most basic of garments featured luxurious details such as French seams and hand crafted buttons.<p>Right: The typical professional suit would run between $50 and $75 – quite the investment in the '60s economy, but worth it for the higher quality.

As it became unfashionable to see the tops of stockings worn with the shorter skirts, pantyhose became the obvious solution.</p></span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <img alt=Covergirl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/covergirl.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Left: Women’s shoes tended toward a sensible, mid-height pump — sometimes referred to as a kitten heel. As the decade wore on, these styles gave way to flat knee boots, Mary Janes, and Dr. Scholl’s clogs by the late '60s.<p>Right: In the '60s, emphasis shifted from the waist to the bosom; nothing showed this off more than the introduction of the Maidenform bullet bra. The ‘Wonder Bra’ and push-up bras followed as the trend toward accentuation became the norm.</p></span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <img alt=Men style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/men.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Left: Left: More of an ‘everywoman’, Natalie Wood made being stylish look effortless, and many women strove to emulate her timeless, classic look.<p>Right: The sharp flannel or wool gray suits and spread collars that are now so immediately identified as the ‘Don Draper look’ were a true staple in the 1960s office.</p></span><span class=credit>Flickr</span> <img alt="Mad Men Fashion Office" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mad-Men-fashion-office.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The classic American suit provided a masculine silhouette: wide cut in the chest and shoulder with a slightly tapered waist to complete the fit.</span><span class=credit><a href=#>Flickr</a></span> <img alt="Mad Men Fashion Copier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mad-Men-fashion-copier.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Any pattern that varied too far from a solid color was deemed too busy for the workplace, and was thus considered casual wear.
