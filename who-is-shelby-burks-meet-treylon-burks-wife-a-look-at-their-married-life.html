It is unclear when the two began dating, although they have supposedly been together since college. Furthermore, the pair routinely posts photos and videos on social media.</p><p>Treylon Burks, 23, is a football player from Flint, Michigan. He is a wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League. Burks attended Warren High School in Arkansas and was a top-rated four-star prospect both nationally and in his home state. Burks attended the University of Arkansas after hurting his ACL in high school and flourished, earning a berth on the SEC All-Freshman team.</p><p>During his second season, he established himself as Arkansas’ top receiver. Then he forewent his final year to enter the NFL draft. The Tennessee Titans chose a wide receiver with the 18th choice in the first round of the draft. Burks is now a rookie with the Titans and is showing promising indications of success.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-shelby-burks-treylon-burks-wife></span>Meet Shelby Burks, Treylon Burks’ Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Treylon Burks and Shelby (Perlman) Burks</strong> are still in their early twenties. The pair does not think they rushed into marriage and is becoming stronger by the day. Shelby Perlman just turned 23 and celebrated her birthday with friends and Treylon in July.&nbsp;Shelby is the youngest of three siblings: Brett, Britney, and Jacob. She is also a wonderful aunt to Addison and Gage.&nbsp;Unfortunately, her mother, Denise Aileen, died after a struggle with Covid-19.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=their-married-life></span>Their Married Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shelby is also a nursing student at the University of Arkansas, therefore it is assumed that Shelby and the WR fell in love there.&nbsp;Mrs. Burks seems to be quite active on both Instagram and Tiktok. She routinely posts cute videos of herself and Treylon, highlighting their vibrant way of life. The couple got engaged in the new year and will move into their new house in July 2022. They will legally marry in July 2023.</p><p>Shelby attends her husband’s matches and helps him in every way she can. Furthermore, the pair is enjoying their ideal married life.&nbsp;There is currently no word about the arrival of a new member of the Burks family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=treylon-burks-has-asthma></span>Treylon Burks has Asthma<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Titans’ wide receiver has a medical problem that might jeopardize his career. Buks has asthma and often needs an inhaler before practices and games.&nbsp;Burks said on the Titans’ website that he has shed 5-6 pounds to better care for his health.&nbsp;Treylon has been unharmed despite his condition. He even said that he felt healthier and played better after joining the squad.</p><p>He said, ”</p><p>“I feel a lot different, and I feel a lot healthier.” It just makes me happy that I can come out here and contribute and be a part of this team.”</p><p>Furthermore, Burks passed the Titans’ fitness test and took part in all practices and games without incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ysn56kkq56o8HRpKpmpZWawW7A0Z6wpaeeYq%2B2vsqsZLChlpp6onnLqKakZZGperW0xKKpZqWRp7%2BqscNmo6KelWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./connecticut-high-school-hockey-player-died-from-skate-cutting-neck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Conn.
