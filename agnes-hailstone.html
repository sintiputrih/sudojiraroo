Hailstone was born in Noorvik, Alaska, on June 14, 1972. The name of her parents is not known to the general media. At times the secrecy is hard to understand.&nbsp; Not only that, but nothing on the siblings is also available to the general media.</p><p>She holds the American nationality with an ethnicity not known to anyone. Sources claim that she is a native of Alaska and has lived all her life there.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Agnes is 48 years old as of now. She stands at a tall height with a pleasant smile in front of the camera all the time. Her body weight is precisely suitable to that of the height she owns. Sadly there is no information about the vital body statistics.</p><p>Agnes has done her bit to maintain a pretty good body even in the late ’40s. All of this might be due to the healthy diet of the lady. To complete the physical outlook, black eyes and dark brown hair play an important role.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Agnes was born in Alaska, spending most of her childhood there with the family and siblings. Her early life was pretty decent, with most of the needs being fulfilled with ease. At times the days were difficult too. Agnes lost her mother and brother to a catastrophic icy water event.</p><p>In the case of educational background, though, there is nothing known to anyone. Either she is highly educated or not, nothing accurate can be said about it.</p><h2>Agnes Hailstone Career</h2><p>Agnes is a renowned and inspirational hunter. Hailstone has a rifle and knife that helps in her hunting and gathering. Agnes owns a Mosin Nagant, which is a five-shot military rifle with a range of 500m.</p><p>Agnes became the main character of the TV series ‘Life Below Zero,’ where she worked with casts like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Bassich.</a> Andy, along with her husband, shows us the daily activities of hunters on the Alaskan plain.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaclyn Hill Net Worth, Career, Dating, Wiki-Bio >></a></h4><p>Agnes is also the principal in the family company named Caribou Arts and Adventures, which now isn’t active.</p><p>Along with her beloved husband Chip, Agnes got featured in the BBC Worldwide documentary that fletched them the maximum number of fans and thus gathered immense fame even in one extreme part of the world.</p><p>In the current scenario, though, Hailstone has appeared in the show for over 100 episodes. Added to the TV appearance, Agnes was seen in an episode of Cost of Winter and also in Race Against Time.</p><h2>Net-Worth</h2><p>Hailstone is one of the leading ladies in the show Life Below Zero. Her contribution to the show has made her a well-known celebrity. All of this has helped Hailstone to make a fair bit of net worth. Agnes’ current salary is <strong>$45k</strong> from the reality show. However, Agnes has an estimated net worth of around <strong>$100 thousand.</strong></p><p>Although there is proper information on net worth and salary, nothing on the assets is known to the general media. Whatever might be the case, Agnes is undoubtedly living a lavish lifestyle with her loved one and children.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Agnes was in a relationship with a man named <strong>Douglas J.</strong> <strong>Carter</strong>.</p><p>Agnes even bore two children with the mysterious man. The name of the children is <strong>Douglas</strong> and <strong>Jon</strong>.&nbsp; Due to various marital problems, Agnes decided to get rid of the relationship with Carter. So after the divorce, Agnes took full authority over the children and moved out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/agnes-033.jpg><p>After some time, Agnes met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chip Hailstone</a>, and both of them got into a great relationship and thus walked the aisle with Chip and started a new family. Not only the marriage scenario, but they are blessed with kids too. Agnes again bor five children with Chip. All of them were daughters. Their name is <strong>Mary, Tinmiaq, Caroline, Quatan, </strong>and<strong> Iriqtaq</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Gatto Wife, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Kids >></a></h4><p>Now Agnes with her husband and seven children reside beside the Kobuk River in the Northwest of Alaska. They hunt and ice-fish to manage their food. Due to the lack of any rift, both of them look pretty happy at where they stand.</p><h2>Tattoo</h2><p>Agnes has four lines tattooed below her chin, which count as her distinctive feature. As each tattoo has its meaning, Hailstone’s tattoo tends to show maturity. Since missionaries banned this tattoo tradition, but credits to Agnes, the striped tattoo is making a comeback.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>Hailstones made the news when her husband Chip was arrested in March of 2018.</p><p>Chip was convicted of two counts of perjury and two counts of false statements to law enforcement officers in the Second Judicial Court in Kotzebue. In 2012, the jury found him guilty on all four charges, due to which he has to face multiple years in prison.</p><p>Chip was convicted after he alleged a state trooper had physically assaulted his then 17-year-old daughter, and their action left his family in bodily harm. On July 13, Chip was charged with another family in Noorvik, where he claimed that the residents had pointed a rifle at his daughter.</p><p>Later in 2014, he continued his fight to clear himself. Still, now he hasn’t been out and still fighting for his convictions.</p><p>The show ‘Life Below Zero’ is now only run by Agnes and her children, and due to his imprisonment, Chip is no longer in the show.</p><h2>Criticism</h2><p>One of the sarcastic yet funny criticisms that comes to the fan for the show is about the weather things.</p><p>Some of the fans criticize the fact saying weather in Alaska is not always below zero. Added to that feature of wifi and roads has undoubtedly made life easier than it shows on the TV.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Hailstone is not so active on social media. She doesn’t have an official Twitter account. Furthermore, she is not keen on social media as well as Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKClnqtdna6quNKtpqedXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./729378-blueface-gets-handsy-unknown-woman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blueface Gets Handsy With Unknown Woman Despite Engagement To Jaidyn Alexis">&larr;
