It looked like it spun a little when it got by the trees.</p><p>“In my 41 years on this planet I have never seen anything like it before. I was in awe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664051383.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664084601.jpg><p>Shaneika said the object was visible for “less than one minute” and was actually one of two, but she “couldn’t keep eyes on them both at the same time”.</p><p>She added: “At first I thought it may have been a plastic bag but I was like, that’s too fast and too high.</p><p>“Some people have said it’s a balloon or a trash bag. However, some have said they believe it’s a cloaked ship.”</p><p>Shaneika’s footage sparked debate after being uploaded online, with speculating commenter’s explanations ranging wildly.</p><p>One person said: “Drone with cloaking tech.”</p><p>Another asked: “Lower atmospheric cloud caught in a back-wind?”</p><p>However, one commented: “That’s a damn plastic bag.”</p><h2>‘NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT’</h2><p>Dismissed as a conspiracy theory for decades, ex-US defence officials, sitting politicians, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have all acknowledged there is something unusual going on in our skies.</p><p>Speculation among UFO fans has been running rife as lawmakers and officials have hinted at potentially significant information compiled in the classified section of Pentagon’s landmark report on alien activity.</p><p>US officials released the highly anticipated public document after giving a secret briefing to Congress two weeks ago – but now everyone is asking, what is in the full version of the dossier?</p><p>Richard Dolan, an American historian who has researched the topic for 25 years, claims one of his sources provided him with details apparently in the section that was briefed to certain US Congressmen and US Senators.</p><p>He alleged the classified portion was 70 pages long and included information about advanced – and potentially alien – propulsion systems and experimental craft using the tech that are <a href=#>being tested at Area 51</a>.</p><p>However, he made clear the information was “unconfirmed”.</p><p>Meanwhile, UFO researcher and professor Bob McGwier claimed 14 videos were shown in the classified briefing – describing it as like a “science fiction movie”.</p><p>He claimed officials redacted everything they could from the report – which saw the public version slashed to just nine pages.</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>What is going on with UFOs in the US?</h3><p>UFOS have stepped from fringe conspiracy theories to a genuine national security debate in the US.</p><p>Pentagon officials last year took the unprecedented step to confirm a trio of remarkable videos which showed US encounters with UFOs.</p><p>The debate is still open as to what the phenomena caught on film were – but it made clear to everyone, something is in the skies.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the “Tic Tac” – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes.</p><p>The US also confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) – a Pentagon programme set up to study UFOs before being disbanded in 2017.</p><p>However, it was replaced by the UAP Task Force in June 2020 after a vote by the US Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Defence chiefs have since confirmed a number of leaked UFO videos and photos which were submitted to the Task Force for investigation.</p><p>Why this sudden rush for transparency?</p><p>No outside the secretive wings of the US government currently knows for sure.</p><p>And as a tacked-on addendum to a 5,500 page Covid relief bill passed in December, the the Director of National Intelligence’s office was ordered to compile a report on UFOs within 180 days.</p><p>The UAP report dropped as expected on June 25, and while not giving much away – it did not rule anything out either as much of it remains classified.</p><p>The US appear to have acknowledged that UFOs – whatever they are – are real and are a potential threat to national security as they appear to be able to enter restricted airspace with total impunity.</p><p>Is it aliens? Officially the US position is simply, “we don’t know yet” as further disclosure is expected in the coming months and years.</p><p>The dossier did however admit there is something in the skies that cannot be explained – and did not rule out a potential alien origin.</p><p>It also revealed the US military cannot explain 143 out of 144 of sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).</p><p>The report – officially titled “Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” –&nbsp;was ordered by Congress as a tacked-on addendum to a Covid relief bill in December.</p><p>It was commissioned after the Pentagon took the extraordinary step of confirmed a trio of stunning videos showing encounters with pilots – admitting they could not explain the phenomena.</p><p>NASA chief Bill Nelson also said last week he has also read the classified version of the report, but didn’t gave much intel.</p><p>“It says basically what we thought. We don’t know the answer to what those Navy pilots saw, they know that they saw something, they tracked it, they locked their radar onto it, they followed it, it would suddenly move quickly from one location to another,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>.</p><p>Shaneika and India’s strange sighting follows another by an eagle-eyed student in Devon, England.</p><p>Matthew Evans, 36, <a href=#>spotted a “bright UFO” hovering above the seafront</a> for 10 seconds, before it spookily sped off into the night sky.</p><p>And a UFO video was allegedly leaked from the US Navy after a <a href=#>swarm of mystery objects were seen “brazenly” buzzing a warship</a> off the coast of San Diego.</p><p>It is the latest snippet of footage reportedly from an extraordinary encounter between the USS Omaha and 14 spherical UFOs said to be tracked at speeds of up to 158mph.</p><p>The footage was released by filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, who has been behind a string of high profile leaks featuring encounters between the US military and unidentified phenomena.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Congress must hold hearings on UFO sightings after long-awaited report was ‘inconclusive,’ rep demands</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnaS6bq3NnWSdmaWctbWx0WadoqSdYq%2BqxsCrqZ5lpZu8bq3SZqSyq6Sav7p5wquYn6xdory3sdJmq6Gqn6q0qXnCpaaunKNirqO71Z5krKelqbVur8CrpqWhnpZ8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./domino-masters-judges.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are the Judges and Host of 'Domino Masters'?
