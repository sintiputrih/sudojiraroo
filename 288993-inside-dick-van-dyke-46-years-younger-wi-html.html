It was his second marriage, and she had been very skeptical about dating him but is totally in love now and doesn't mind spending all her time with him.</p><p class=dh>Dick Van Dyke is one of the icons of the golden age of entertainment, but he has a very complex private life, especially where women are concerned. The talented actor met his first wife, Margie Willet, in 1945 at the age of 20.</p><p class=dh>In a memoir he released in 2012 titled "My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business," Dick revealed that Willet had been a local girl he had known for some time before she dumped her boyfriend to be with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/52da7578ba6a58412caec9d524d5316c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>[Left] Actor Dick Van Dyke and his wife Arlene Silver at the ceremony honoring posthumously Peter Falk with a Star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 25, 2013 in Hollywood, California; [Center] Dick Van Dyke at a garden dancing; [Right] Dick Van Dyke and his wife Arlene Silver sitting and speaking in an interview with CBS Moring. | Source: Getty Images. instagram.com/official_dick_van_dyke. twitter.com/CBSMornings</p><p class=dh>After they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/476316/the-truth-about-dick-van-dykes-affair/>started</a> dating, Van Dyke tried his hand at advertising; however that did not last long, and before long, he was back at a local radio station where he had worked as a high school student.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, it paid peanuts, and when the time came to get married, the couple was too broke to afford it.</p><p class=dh>Thankfully, they got enrolled in a radio show called "Bride and Groom," According to Heavy.com, the show handled the wedding preparations and offered to sponsor their honeymoon afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a6d9b1f9b4f1bbdae8baa58ac4b865ed.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>American actor Dick Van Dyke pictured with his wife Margie Willett in London in 1964. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/margie-willett/>wedding</a> took place in 1948, and they later settled in Malibu while he started his acting career and got a duplex to themselves. During that time, they conceived twins, but a miscarriage occurred, and while they were taking care of that in the hospital, their landlord evicted them because of overdue rent.</p><p class=dh>After that, the actor started traveling a lot to work, but they somehow managed to expand their family four times over the years so that by 1961 they were proud parents of four kids: Christian, Barry, Stacy, and Carrie.</p><p class=dh>It was a perfect family, but unfortunately, the actor's work often saw him travel, which meant he had only fleeting time for family. The pair split up in 1976 after Van Dyke confessed to getting intimate with a woman named Michelle Triola, and by 1984 the divorce was finalized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f809b96a9b85692c85e362dc9e7c4ff9.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Dick Van Dyke and son Chris Van Dyke at the Television Critics Association Awards Luncheon on July 15, 2000 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pasadena, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Their first child, Chris, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/dick-van-dykes-kids-meet-christian-barry-carrie-and-stacy/>appeared</a> briefly alongside his dad on his self-titled show before launching his own acting career.
