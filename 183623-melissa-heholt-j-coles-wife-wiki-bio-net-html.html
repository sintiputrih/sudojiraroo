Although she is an event planner, she also works for her husband's foundation, which helps the youth in their community.</p><p class=dh>Born the eldest of four children, Melissa Heholt grew up surrounded by children and caring for them. Now, she is a mother to two beautiful children, whom she shares with her husband, J. Cole, born Jermaine Lamarr Cole.</p><p class=dh>The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony without the media's attention. They quietly started their family with small disclosures about their kids to the press.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f6202e6149814d45548e7511991ba294cad0d804d3609734ef453982d719c1a5.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>J.
