Answer
This kind of mechanical conduit bender is manual and derives its name from…well…Chicago, Illinois. Instead of EMT, these sorts of benders are generally employed for RMC (rigid metal conduit) or IMC (intermediate metal conduit) applications (electrical metallic conduit).
Also, can a Chicago bender be used to bend EMTs into shape? Use a 1″ EMT bender for 34″ rigid or IMC tubing. Hickey benders are exclusively used for rigid or IMC tubing since they would kink EMT tubing if used on flexible tubing (except for very small bends).</description></item><item><title>Who is Dylan Jagger Lee dating?
