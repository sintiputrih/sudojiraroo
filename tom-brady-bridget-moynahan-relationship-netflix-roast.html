That may be why Brady seemed so upset when his <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> roast included a joke about his past relationship with Bridget Moynahan.</p><p>This article will reveal how <strong>Tom Brady reacted after a roast joke about his relationship with Bridget Moynahan</strong>.

For a celebrity to be chosen to be the topic of a roast is widely considered to be a huge honor by many people.</p><p>That said, anyone who has watched footage of a roast should know that they are incredibly harsh events. Whether Tom Brady knew what he was in for during his 2024 roast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a joke Nikki Glaser made</a><strong>about his relationship with Bridget Moynahan seemed to shock him</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tom-brady-and-bridget-moynahan.jpg><p>Before Tom Brady married Gisele Bündchen, and they had two children together, he dated Moynahan for months.

'It's hard to walk away from something that isn't your pregnant girlfriend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nikki-glaser-at-the-netflix-roast-of-tom-brady.jpg><p>Up until this point in Glaser's joke, the comedian made it seem like Brady intentionally broke up with Bridget Moynahan when she was pregnant. In reality, however, <strong>Brady seemingly was completely unaware that Moynahan was carrying his child</strong> when they split.</p><p>To Glaser's credit, she played up the fact that Brady didn't know Moynahan was pregnant to make fun of the football great even more.</p><p>"To be fair, he didn't know.

As Glaser joked, Brady's extreme diet resulted in him losing the family he had with Gisele Bündchen.</p><p>After that joke, the roast's producers cut to a wide shot that included Brady. As a result, viewers got to see that <strong>Brady looked upset</strong> as he spoke to the person seated beside him seemingly about Glaser's jokes.</p><p>Of course, there is no way to know for sure that Brady was upset at that moment. However, it is easy to understand why Brady may have been upset that Glaser brought up his three children in a roundabout way.</p><h2 id=was-tom-brady-really-mad-at-jeff-ross-39-roast-joke-about-robert-kraft>Was Tom Brady Really Mad At Jeff Ross' Roast Joke About Robert Kraft?</h2><p>Between the years 2000 and 2019, Tom Brady made a staggering amount of money as the quarterback for the New England Patriots. Throughout that time of almost two decades, Patriots owner Robert Kraft was the one who helped make Brady incredibly rich and famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/does-tom-brady-risk-his-entire-sports-analyst-salary-if-he-doesn-t-complete-his-10-year-contract_-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>Given the roles that Brady and Kraft had in each other's lives, it would make sense for the two men to feel mutual loyalty. It seems like that loyalty survived Brady going on to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and then retiring.</p><p>Given Brady and Kraft's bond, the former football star should have expected there to be jokes about Kraft during his roast. Still, for many viewers, <strong>it seemed like Brady was mad that Ross joked about Kraft</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-cast-of-whose-line-is-it-anyway-roasted-drew-carey-in-these-edgy-moments-whose-line-is-it-anyway-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Cast Of Whose Line Is It Anyway Roasted Drew Carey In These Edgy Moments</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The cast of Whose Line Is It Anyway seems to delight in mocking the show's host Drew Carey.</span><p>In 2019, Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting following an investigation into Florida massage parlors. Ultimately, Kraft was cleared of all charges but the situation was such a big controversy that football fans certainly haven't forgotten.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Tom Brady's roast was streamed live on Netflix in 2024, the service held a similar event. In 2021, Netflix users got the chance to watch the roast of The Jonas Brothers.</p><p>As a result of how memorable this incident was, Jeff Ross made a joke about it. While describing a theoretical conversation between Brady and Kraft, Ross pretended to be the football star asking the Patriots' owner if he wanted a massage.</p><p>Several seconds after Ross' joke got a big laugh, the comedian was milking the response. At that moment, it seemed like Brady believed Ross was going to continue talking about Kraft's massage controversy. As a CBS Sports article about the roast describes, Brady got out of his chair, walked over to Ross who was still at the microphone, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>told the comedian, "Don't say that s**t again."</strong></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jeff-ross-and-kevin-hart-at-the-netflix-roast-of-tom-brady.jpg><p>After the roast, Jeff Ross made an appearance on The Rich Eisen Show. Unsurprisingly, Eisen asked Ross if Brady really was mad at his joke about Kraft. In response, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross stated that Brady wasn't actually mad</a></strong> and claimed the football legend was just playing along.</p><p>"Come on. Come on. No way. No way. He was having fun. He was having fun, you know? It's like, that's his dad, you know? That's like, Robert Kraft is like a father figure to him, you know? He was just showing his love for Robert Kraft."</p><p>Ross also told Eisen that Robert Kraft loved the joke. "And Robert Kraft loved it. We had a great talk afterward, and he was so happy that I gave him a shout-out and a salute."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmmauhlJyytXnMqLCnmZiWu26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mpZ6slqG2uXnRqJisrF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-matt-brown-from-alaskan-bush-people-meet-his-parents-and-wife-2-448659-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Matt Brown From Alaskan Bush People?
