According to Tsai, no one should face discrimination because of their religious convictions.</strong></p><p>Tsai made his initial investment in the NBA franchise in 2017 and now co-owns it with his wife Clara Wu. At the time, Tsai acquired a 49% stake in the NBA; two years later, in 2019, he acquired the remaining shares.</p><p>The multimillionaire did all in his power to elevate the Nets to the NBA’s elite division. At one point, the Nets’ roster included Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant. That being said, nothing notable came of this. In recent seasons, the Nets have emerged as the most theatrical team in the NBA. Tsai has acknowledged that it’s challenging to manage NBA players.</p><h2><span id=Joe_Tsais_Religion_Is_He_Christian_Muslim_Or_Jewish>Joe Tsai’s Religion: Is He Christian Muslim Or Jewish?</span></h2><p>Millionaire Christian Taiwanese-Canadian Joe Tsai practices Christianity. The owner of the Nets wed Clara Wu at Park Avenue Christian Church in 1996. Their wedding ceremony was performed by a Baptist clergyman.</p><p>In the same year that former Nets player Kyrie Irving got into problems, Joe Tsai also talked about his beliefs. Joe Tsai released a statement in the press when Iriving posted an anti-Semitic video on Twitter. The billionaire immediately took to Twitter to criticize Kyrie’s behavior.</p><p>Joe Tsai describes himself as “a man of faith,” meaning that he thinks it is wrong for anybody to hate someone because of their race, ethnicity, or religion. However, a lot of people have questioned why Joe Tsai hasn’t spoken out against the Chinese government’s mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims if, as he claims, he is “a man of faith.”</p><h2><span id=Joe_Tsai_Family_Details>Joe Tsai Family Details</span></h2><p>Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Joe Tsai immigrated to the US at the age of thirteen. The owner of the Brooklyn Nets, Paul C. Tsai, is a second-generation lawyer who followed in his father’s legal career. After graduating from Yale University with a bachelor’s degree in economics and East Asian studies, Joe enrolled in the Yale Law School’s J.D. program.</p><p>Tsai passed the New York Bar exam and was admitted to the bar in 1991. Five years later, he married fellow Stanford alumna Clara Wu. At the time, Clara worked for American Express Travel Related Services. Clara and her spouse are involved in several philanthropic activities, such as founding the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation. The three kids of the marriage, Alex, Dash, and Jacob, carry on the lacrosse-playing family legacy. Joe, a former lacrosse player, and his daughter were in one of the videos on a YouTube channel.</p><h2><span id=Alex_Tsai_Joe_Tsais_Daughter_Is_a_Stanford_Student>Alex Tsai, Joe Tsai’s Daughter, Is a Stanford Student</span></h2><p>The daughter of Joe Tsai, Alex Tsai, played lacrosse for Stanford University for three seasons, totaling thirteen games played. She worked on the Farmlink Project last year and received a master’s degree in Management Science and Engineering. Alex is now in charge of the personnel at Mem, an autonomous workplace. In 2020, Pac-12 Networks released a YouTube video with Alex and her father talking about her family’s experience living under quarantine and her love for the Farmlink Project.</p><h2><span id=Joe_Tsai_Both_Sons_Play_Lacrosse>Joe Tsai Both Sons Play Lacrosse</span></h2><p>Dash and Jacob play lacrosse, carrying on their father’s legacy. The middle child of the Tsai family, Dash Tsai, attends Stanford University and has represented Hong Kong internationally. Jacob Tsai, the youngest child of Joe Tsai, is a lacrosse player as well. He helped his sister shoot her film in the past.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
