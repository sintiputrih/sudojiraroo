Princess Charlotte's name</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dca06035ac03-gettyimages-1252791576.jpg><p id=e9zd4CywowN7 data-wc=47>While Diana never saw the birth of her grandchildren, William and Kate found a truly touching way to remember the Princess when their daughter was born in 2015. <strong>The couple chose to name their second child after Diana and gave her the full name Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.</strong></p><p id=e2WXJVaSPiU- data-wc=31>Apart from the connection with William's mother, the sweet moniker also paid tribute to Her Majesty the Queen. Elizabeth is also the middle name of Kate and her mum Carole Middleton.</p><h2>2. Princess Charlotte was christened in the same church as Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1923891571a6-sandringham-church.jpg><p id=e24a1zxz62zZ data-wc=38>After naming Princess Charlotte after Diana, William and Kate went one step further and <strong>decided to baptise their little girl in a venue that holds a special place in their hearts – St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham.</strong></p><p id=eJ_tDuG9tXSd data-wc=20>The church, which is located on the Sandringham Estate, is the same place where Diana was christened in August 1961.</p><h2>3. Kate called to mind Diana when she left hospital with baby George</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24ffaf8b98bd-kate-diana-lindo.jpg><p id=e__YUGBWNP5V data-wc=45>Cradling her newborn son in her arms as she faced the media on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London in 2013, Kate called to mind Diana when she presented her first child William to the world back in 1982.</p><p id=ePVZEdqhG8Cf data-wc=28><strong>The Princess wore an empire line, polka dot blue frock for her first appearance as a mum; Diana left hospital in a similar dotted dress by Catherine Walker.</strong></p><p id=eQxtCF1HCoWZ data-wc=49>Given that Kate's dress was made especially for her by one of her favourite designers Jenny Packham, the similarity between the two outfits was probably no coincidence. Just as returning to the same hospital where William and Harry were born was a deliberate choice to honour a family tradition.</p><h2>4. Kate sent Prince George to a Montessori school</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e6599c800ae-william-nursery.jpg><p id=et1pvWGaTE4S data-wc=35>It was Diana who insisted that her children be <a class=hm-link href=#>educated outside the palace walls</a>, so when the time came for William to start nursery, she enrolled him at Mrs. Mynors Nursery School in west London.</p><p id=eSfx1OCFndrN data-wc=21>Diana herself was a nursery assistant at the Young England Kindergarten school in Pimlico, a nursery that uses the Montessori method.&nbsp;</p><p id=egOXNlQiA6-e data-wc=35><strong>It was therefore no surprise that she wanted her sons to be schooled in the same way</strong> – a teaching method that balances work and play and encourages children to develop at their own rate.&nbsp;</p><p id=e82Bvl9gzxN2 data-wc=38>Fast forward more than 30 years and William and Kate's son George also attended a Montessori nursery. The little boy started his education at the Westacre Montessori School in Norfolk and spent a few mornings a week there.</p><h2>5.

According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Good Housekeeping</a>, body language expert Patti Wood says that their body language with children is very similar.</p><p id=eoD1EsezU6t4 data-wc=55>Comparing photos of the mothers, she said: <strong>"Both women are incredibly hands-on, they're always fixated on their children, even with the chaos around them."</strong> Describing a photo of Diana with a hand on William's tummy, she continued: "This 1-on-1 connection makes children feel safe. It's an anchoring movement that's especially important in potentially stressful situations."</p><p id=ePbTj7gPDRv data-wc=11><strong>SEE: &nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>13 of Princess Diana's cutest moments with William and Harry</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/395d3cbc9005-diana-william-harry-1986.jpg><p id=eOe3BcaP6_eb data-wc=38>Commenting on a similar photo of Kate and George, she added: "This is one way that parents show their children that they're equals. We see this with Princess Diana and Kate Middleton, as well as with Prince William."</p><h2>6. Kate wears Princess Diana's sapphire engagement ring</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd47d998a863-kate-diana-engagement-ring.jpg><p id=e92dCH-SIl81 data-wc=42>At almost every royal engagement Kate attends, the Princess never fails to wear her <a class=hm-link href=#>impressive diamond engagement ring,</a> which used to belong to Diana. Back in 2010, <strong>Prince William popped the question to his future wife with his mother's stunning sapphire accessory.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ejVJKvwXu3v0 data-wc=26>The ring, which consists of a 12-carat oval Ceylon sapphire surrounded by a cluster of 14 diamonds set in white gold, was created by jeweller Garrard.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1Fo9B_wCY2w data-wc=34>At the time of her engagement to Prince Charles, Diana selected the ring herself from the jeweller's catalogue; some have said that the Princess chose it because it reminded her of her mother's ring.</p><p id=e-gLnZdZuy data-wc=11><strong>MORE: &nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>7 jewels Princess Kate has worn from Princess Diana's collection</a></p><h2>7.

They were remodelled for the Duchess who wore them for the first time when she and William watched Andy Murray from the Royal Box at Wimbledon in 2011.</p><p id=eiIJcleAr_S data-wc=14><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>12 times the new Princess of Wales dressed like her mother-in-law Princess Diana</a></p><h2>8.

Kate wears Diana's favourite tiara for special occasions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5849a630e98-kate-middleton-tiara-2.jpg><p id=eizv0ahBNB11 data-wc=54>It was only the third time that she had worn a tiara in public but Kate seemed to have her late mother-in-law in mind when she attended the late Queen's annual diplomatic reception in December 2015 . <strong>The Duchess opted for the dazzling Lover's Knot tiara, which was a firm favourite of Princess Diana.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ewZD7IUjt6fz data-wc=18>Since then, it has been the tiara Kate has worn most for state banquets and the diplomatic reception.&nbsp;</p><h2>10. Kate takes style inspiration for her children from Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02080af8a869-gettyimages-479552358.jpg><p id=e15CSjLQ_LX3 data-wc=63>When Prince George attended his sister's christening in July 2015, the youngster was dressed head-to-toe in an outfit similar to what his dad William once wore as a child. Clad in an embroidered white shirt and red shorts, <strong>George was the spitting image of his father&nbsp;</strong>when William went to the hospital to meet his brother Harry for the first time in 1984.</p><p id=eXyL4XQvGQgd data-wc=79>Rachel Riley designed George's outfit, and admitted that she spotted similarities between the way Kate and Diana dressed their children. <strong>"Diana dressed Prince William in a very traditional way, even more traditional than Kate does with Prince George,"&nbsp;</strong>the designer told . "George always looks gorgeous, too. His clothing is very classic but suitable for today, that's the look they are trying to achieve. It's a more modern version of William's look when he was a little boy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0affb421ab31-gettyimages-477035344-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24d9cc702255-gettyimages-499243504.jpg><p id=eURRQgXuPAaX data-wc=45>This wasn't the first time George had drawn comparisons to his father William. A month earlier in June at the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony, <strong>George wore the exact same pale blue outfit that his dad William wore back in 1984&nbsp;</strong>for the Queen's birthday.</p><p id=e_bG-cQ-0yea data-wc=18>Held by his doting dad, George gave an adorable wave from the palace balcony to the well-wishers below.</p><h2>11. Kate loves skiing with her children like Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03842963574b-george-first-holiday.jpg><p id=en3N-hCy9BC7 data-wc=44>Unbeknownst to the media and the public, William and Kate took their first secret holiday as a family of four in March 2016. The then Cambridges visited their favourite region in the French Alps, where George and Charlotte experienced their first taste of snow. &nbsp;</p><p id=e-MAltkzxq data-wc=53>The official portraits that were released via Kensington Palace after the trip called to mind<strong>&nbsp;the family holidays Diana used to enjoy with her sons William and Harry</strong>. &nbsp;The Princess would take her children on winter breaks, often to Lech in Austria, where they practised skiing together and rode side-by-side on ski lifts.</p><h2>12. William and Kate follow in Diana's footsteps at the Taj Mahal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a5943325722d-kate-diana-taj-mahal.jpg><p id=e6MrJSqCmVTI data-wc=69>Some 24 years after Diana visited the Taj Mahal – one of the most famous symbols of India – William and Kate followed in the Princess's footsteps and even <strong>recreated the same iconic pose&nbsp;</strong>during their official tour in 2016. "I hope you've got the symmetry right, Arthur," the Prince even joked to veteran royal photographer Arthur Edwards, who was among those who had photographed Diana in the nineties.</p><p id=ecVPKPIlEPDG data-wc=38>The photocall on "Lady Di's chair" lasted less than a minute, and couldn't have been a starker contrast to when Diana visited the Taj alone, without Prince Charles, and <strong>told reporters that she found the experience "very healing"</strong>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
