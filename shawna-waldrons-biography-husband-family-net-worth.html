Following her initial success, Shawna was chosen for the part of Lucy Shepherd, the daughter of Michael Douglas’ character in the film “The American President” in 1995.</p><p>Before the end of the ‘90s, Shawna continued with popular roles, firstly as Sarah Marshall in the television film “A Change of Heart”, and then as Anne Harrison in the TV comedy series “Family Rules” (1999). Also, she secured the recurring role of Bonnie Stiles in yet another comedy series, “Ladies Man” (1999-2000).

She didn’t have much success in the 2000s as an actress, making it hard for her to continue her <a rel=nofollow href=#>career</a>, however, she was Azalea in the television film “Poison Ivy: The Secret Society” in 2008, and Amanda in the drama film “3 Days in L.A.” in 2009.</p><p>Since 2010, Shawna hasn’t been quite so active as an actress, but still made a few notable appearances.
