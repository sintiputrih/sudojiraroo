Eight years later, he is appearing as <strong>Shane</strong> in the anticipated Netflix series Tiny Pretty Things alongside his girlfriend. But fans are still confused about the sexuality of the actor, and we are here to help cut through the confusion.</p><p>The Canadian actor <a href=#>was born on</a> 20 October 1994 in Burlington, Ontario. Bullied at a young age, Brennan found comfort in dancing and later made it his passion training at different studios in Ontario. After finishing high school, Brennan wanted to study medicine at University but a talk from his dance teacher meant he auditioned and later got into the Juilliard School.</p><p>Brennan graduated from the Juilliard School in 2016 and continued on a career as a dancer. While he had been in movies and TV shows before, Brennan Clost's first major role came in The Next Step. But his biggest appearance will be in Tiny Pretty Things as Shane alongside his girlfriend.</p><h2>Brennan Clost Girlfriend - Who is the Actor Dating?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/12/brennan-clost-girlfriend-2021.jpg alt=brennan-clost-girlfriend-2021 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Brennan Clost is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend Casimere Jollette, while some fans he is gay.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Brennan Clost Instagram</a></strong></p><p>Brennan Clost was hired to appear in the Netflix series Tiny Pretty Things in 2019. The show started filming soon after and among the cast was <strong>Casimere Jollette</strong>. While filming the Netflix show, friendship turned into affection for one another and Brenna Clost started dating his girlfriend Casimere Jollette.</p><p>Casimere Jollette was hired to play Bette in the Netflix series. Similar to Brennan Clost, she is a dancer who was cast to play a ballet school student. While she was probably not expecting to fall in love while filming the show but that is the pesky thing about love, it just creeps in.</p><p><strong>Recommended: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Barton Cowperthwaite Girlfriend – Oren Actor is Currently Dating His GF</a></strong></p><p>Brenna posted their first picture together in August of 2019. Though they never formally announced their relationship, calling each other friends early on, later their Instagram grids were filled with pictures of the two lovebirds.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>From being friends to Casimere calling Brennan husband, the relationship seemingly moved pretty fast. The couple still mentions each other as friends but there seems to be something more than friendship between the two.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Daniela Norman Boyfriend – Relationship Detail for June Actress in Tiny Pretty Things</a></strong></p><p>Brennan even called her "life partner," make of that what you will but the actor surely knows how to confuse everyone. There are also those who think Brennan is gay but the actor has not confirmed it himself. Our guess is the actor is currently in a relationship with his girlfriend Casimere, but we could be wrong, this whole thing is pretty confusing.</p><h2>Brennan Clost's Sexuality - "Not Straight"</h2><p>As mentioned above Brennan Clost has thousands of fans confused on his Instagram page. Some believe Casimere Jollette to be his girlfriend while others are convinced the Candian actor is gay. Well, we were confused also after watching some of the videos he has done with <strong>Keara Graves</strong>.</p><p><strong>Interesting Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Michael Hsu Rosen Boyfriend – Proud Gay Actor Plays Nabil in Tiny Pretty Things</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actor <a href=# rel=noopener>himself revealed</a> on TikTok that he is "not straight." In the caption of his TikTok video that actor wrote, "I don't label myself, so don't label me pls. The only thing I know for sure is I'm not straight." We were going to say the actor was bisexual but since he does not want any labels, let's stick with "not straight" as his sexuality.</p><h2>Brennan Clost Plays Shane in the Netflix Series Tiny Pretty Things</h2><p></p><p>Tiny Pretty Things is about the cutthroat world of elite ballet dancing school where students will do anything to get ahead. From entitled kids to small-town hopefuls, all battle out to please a teacher who demands nothing short of perfection. Then there is the case of a dead ballerina which brings its own spin on the story.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The story of the <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series is based on the book of the same name and features a cast of professional dancers. Brennan Clost plays Shane in Tiny Pretty Things. He is appearing in the show alongside his alleged girlfriend Casimere Jollette. Shane is a dancer from a small town who was bullied and pushed around for his love of dancing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Kylie Jefferson as Neveah in Tiny Pretty Things – 5 Quick Facts</a></strong></p><p>The experience of his younger days has made Shane a hot-head who has the burden of being the last hope of his family. Pressure from all sides does not help the mental fortitude of the young dancer. Shane will either rise to the top or succumb under the pressure he never wanted in the first place.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Tiny Pretty Things</strong></a> will be released on 14 December 2020. The cast includes <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jefferson</strong></a> as <strong>Neveah Stroyer</strong>, <strong>Lauren Holly</strong> as <strong>Monique Dubois</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Casimere Jollette</strong></a> as <strong>Bette Whitlaw</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Daniela Norman</strong></a> as <strong>June Park</strong>, Brennan Clost as Shane, <a href=#><strong>Michael Hsu Rosen</strong></a> as <strong>Nabil</strong>, <strong>Damon J.
