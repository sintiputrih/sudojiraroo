Meanwhile, 60 percent of them had an unfavorable view of Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington. All in all, many white people were not afraid to say they opposed the civil rights movement while it was actually happening.</p><p>The Alabama newspaper Montgomery Advertiser <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loudly declared in 1955</a>, "The white man's economic artillery is far superior, better emplaced, and commanded by more experienced gunners. Second, the white man holds all the offices of government machinery. There will be white rule for as far as the eye can see. Are those not facts of life?"</p><p>But it wasn't just people in the South who had a problem with civil rights. In 1964, a majority of white New Yorkers said the civil rights movement had gone too far. All across the country, many people shared that view.</p><h2>The Fight To Keep America Segregated</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-286783 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/white-man-tears-signs.jpg alt="White Man Tears Signs" width=800 height=987 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-286783 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Underwood Archives/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A white teenager rips up a civil rights sign outside a Tallahassee store in 1960.</span></p><p>After the historic U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia said, "If we can organize the Southern States for massive resistance to this order, I think that in time the rest of the country will realize that racial integration is not going to be accepted in the South."</p><p>So as civil rights activists marched in the streets for integration, their opponents also mobilized. They jeered and harassed Black students – some as young as six years old – who enrolled in previously all-white schools. They pulled their children from public schools and sent them to private ones. And they attacked Black communities using the power of the state.</p><p>Alabama's governor George Wallace vowed, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever," in his 1963 inaugural address. Under Wallace, state troopers and police officers carried out his segregationist vision using the power of government.</p><h2>Schools Were The Front Lines Of The Fight</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-286757 alt="James Meredith With Marshals" width=900 height=603 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/james-meredith-with-marshals.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-286757 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>In 1962, James Meredith became the first African American student to attend the University of Mississippi.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, many schools in the South became a battlefield in the fight as mobs of white protestors threw rocks and bottles at Black students.</p><p>When a six-year-old Black girl named Ruby Bridges integrated a New Orleans elementary school in 1960, a white woman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shoved a coffin holding a Black doll</a> in the child's face. Other white protestors threatened to hang Ruby.</p><p>In 1957, segregationists <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called the parents of Black first graders in Tennessee</a>, threatening to shoot, hang, or bomb anyone who sent their children to the previously all-white elementary schools. One Black student attended Hattie Cotton Elementary School on the first day of classes in 1957 – and that night, white supremacists blew up the school.</p><p>Violent protests and states ignoring federal orders kept nearly all Southern schools segregated well into the 1960s. In 1964, just 2.3 percent of Black students attended schools that were majority-white.</p><h2>The Anti-Civil Rights Movement Was National, Not Just Southern</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-286742 alt="Anti Busing Demonstration In Boston" width=900 height=605 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/anti-busing-demonstration-boston.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-286742 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Boston Globe/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>An anti-busing group holds a massive protest in Boston in 1973.</span></p><p>Opposition to the civil rights movement was not restricted to the South. In fact, by 1970, residential segregation was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worse in the North and West</a> than in the South.</p><p>A counter-protester threw a rock at Martin Luther King Jr. during a 1966 march in Chicago. "I have seen many demonstrations in the south but I have never seen anything so hostile and so hateful as I've seen here today," King <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said of the march</a>.</p><p>In Boston, the 1974 busing crisis saw white parents <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leave their school district altogether</a> rather than send their children to integrated schools.</p><p>Many of them participated in anti-busing protests, resisting the city's plan for buses that took Black students to majority-white schools and white students to majority-Black schools.</p><p>Meanwhile, some other people in the North voiced more explicit support for segregation — and racist views on interracial marriage.</p><p>Orville Hubbard, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan from 1942 to 1978, told the New York Times, "I favor segregation, because if you have integration, first you have kids going to school together, then next thing you know, they're grab-assing around, then they're getting married and having half-breed kids. Then you wind up with a mongrel race. And from what I know of history, that's the end of civilization."</p><h2>The Anti-Civil Rights Movement Continued After The 1960s</h2><p>Although the civil rights movement achieved major legislative and legal victories, opposition to civil rights continued.</p><p>However, the language of civil rights opponents changed after the 1960s. Instead of using the N-word, explained Reagan advisor Lee Atwater, "You say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff."</p><p>Coded language like "law and order" also signaled opposition to Black rights. During the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush's Willie Horton ad <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">implied his opponent's "soft on crime" policies</a> allowed a Black convict to rape a white woman.</p><p>Perhaps even more publicly, many states <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">erected Confederate monuments</a> after the civil rights movement. In Tennessee, at least 30 Confederate monuments went up after 1976.</p><p>More than a century after the South lost the war, these monuments reminded many Americans of "white rule."</p><p>The images only tell part of the story.
