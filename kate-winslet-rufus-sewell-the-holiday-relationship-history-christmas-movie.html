Keep reading to find out which actor she had a fling with and how she felt about their on-set reunion years later.</p><h2 id=lsquo-the-holiday-rsquo-starring-kate-winslet-and-cameron-diaz>‘The Holiday’ Starring Kate Winslet And Cameron Diaz</h2><p>Released in 2006, The Holiday is now one of the most popular and beloved Christmas films of all time. The iconic story takes place in two primary locations: a mansion in Los Angeles and a little cottage outside of London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two main characters, Iris and Amanda, are both sick of men and decide they need to go on a solo vacation over Christmas.</p><p>The women connect online and swap houses for two weeks, sending Amanda to Iris’s English cottage and Iris to Beverly Hills. While the ladies are in their new Christmas travel spots, they meet new love interests and form new relationships over the holidays.</p><p>Iris was expertly played by Kate Winslet while Cameron Diaz executed the role of Amanda. Their love interests, Miles and Graham, were played by Jack Black and Jude Law respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “villain” of the rom-com is Jasper Bloom, a co-worker of Iris’ who has strung her along for years and just announced his engagement to another woman, leaving a devastated Iris eager to travel across the Atlantic to escape him.</p><p>Jasper is played by British actor Rufus Sewell. Most fans of The Holiday don’t realize that Sewell and Winslet used to date!</p><h2 id=kate-winslet-and-rufus-sewell-in-lsquo-the-holiday-rsquo>Kate Winslet And Rufus Sewell In ‘The Holiday’</h2><p>The dynamic between Iris and Jasper in the movie leaves a lot of room for Iris to grow.

And YOU’RE not going to be in it.”</p><h2 id=the-relationship-between-kate-winslet-and-rufus-sewell>The Relationship Between Kate Winslet And Rufus Sewell</h2><p>Viewers are so happy to see Iris be rid of Jasper that it’s difficult to imagine Kate Winslet and Rufus Sewell being friendly in real life. But according to Ranker, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these two did date for real</a> for a few months between 1995 and 1996.</p><p>At this point in her career, Winslet was just about to star in Titanic, the biggest film role of her life, and the one that would launch her to superstardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Sewell had also starred in a few projects but was a few years off acting in the film that led to his commercial breakthrough: A Knight’s Tale, where he played the villain Count Adhemar opposite Heath Ledger.</p><h2 id=what-was-their-reunion-like-on-the-set-of-lsquo-the-holiday-rsquo>What Was Their Reunion Like On The Set Of ‘The Holiday’</h2><p>Everyone knows that working with an ex can be super-awkward.

But she ended up being a success as Iris and had a blast on the set.</p><p>“I think the thing I loved the most about Iris is that it was an opportunity for me to play somebody who was emotionally complex, because I do believe that she is,” the actress explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with Collider</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“But at the same time she’s such a good person, she really is. She’s a very decent, honest, English girl, you know, she has quite traditional values and I’m like that myself also. And it was really a pleasure to play somebody who I was able to fully embrace and really adore, I mean I genuinely adored playing this part.”</p><h2 id=kate-winslet-rsquo-s-relationship-with-jack-black>Kate Winslet’s Relationship With Jack Black</h2><p>Though Kate Winslet dated Rufus Sewell in real life, her on-screen love interest was Jack Black, who played Miles.
