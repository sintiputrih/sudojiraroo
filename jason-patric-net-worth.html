He is known for his performances in various films such as “The Lost Boys,” “Sleepers,” “Your Friends & Neighbors,” “Narc,” and “The Alamo.”</p><p>He has also appeared on television, playing Dr. Theo Yedlin in “Wayward Pines,” and in TV movies such as “Toughlove” and “The Girl in the Bathtub.” Patric has also been on Broadway, performing in revivals of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and “That Championship Season.”</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Jason Patric was born in Queens, New York, in 1966. His mother, Linda, is an actress and the daughter of comedian Jackie Gleason. His father, Jason, was a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Academy Award-nominated actor. Patric has a half-brother, actor Joshua John Miller, from his father’s previous marriage.</p><p>Patric grew up in the Upper Saddle River borough of Bergen County, New Jersey, attending Cavallini Middle School and Salesian Roman Catholic Don Bosco Preparatory High School, an all-boys institution. He later moved to California and enrolled at Saint Monica Catholic High School, where he appeared in school productions of “Grease” and “Dracula.”</p><p>After graduating, Patric made his screen-acting debut in the 1985 television film “Toughlove,” starring Bruce Dern.</p><h2><span id=Jason_Patrics_Early_Film_Career>Jason Patric’s Early Film Career</span></h2><p>One year after “Toughlove,” Patric made his film debut in “Solarbabies” in 1986. He then starred in the iconic teen horror film “The Lost Boys” in 1987 alongside Jami Gertz, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, and Corey Feldman. Patric also appeared in the war film “The Beast” with Stephen Baldwin and George Dzundza. His biggest year in film was 1990 when he starred in three movies including “Denial,” “After Dark, My Sweet,” and “Frankenstein Unbound.”</p><h2><span id=Jason_Patrics_Acting_Career>Jason Patric’s Acting Career</span></h2><p>Throughout the 1990s, Jason Patric appeared in several crime dramas, including “Rush” and “Narc,” where he played undercover cops.

In the 2000s, he continued to act in various genres, including the mystery drama “In the Valley of Elah,” the Alec Baldwin comedy “Shortcut to Happiness,” and the action thriller “The Prince,” with Bruce Willis and John Cusack. He has also appeared in horror films, such as “The Abandoned,” and war films, such as “The Yellow Birds.”</p><p>Patric’s more recent acting credits include the mystery adventure “Lost & Found,” the action crime drama “Gangster Land,” and the TV series “Wayward Pines.” With a career spanning over three decades, Patric has proven his versatility as an actor and has become a recognizable face in Hollywood.</p><h2><span id=Jason_Patrics_Career_on_TV>Jason Patric’s Career on TV</span></h2><p>Jason Patric’s career on the small screen has not been as prolific as his film-acting career. He hosted an episode of “Saturday Night Live” in 1994 and made a guest appearance as himself on “Entourage” in 2008. In 2016, he had a more significant role on the Fox series “Wayward Pines,” playing Dr. Theodore Yedlin in the show’s second season.</p><h2><span id=Jason_Patrics_Broadway_Revivals>Jason Patric’s Broadway Revivals</span></h2><p>In 2005, Patric starred in the Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams’ “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” alongside Ashley Judd, Ned Beatty, and Margo Martindale.

He later had an on-and-off relationship with Danielle Schreiber for about a decade, during which they conceived a son via in vitro fertilization. However, after their split in 2012, Patric was initially denied custody of his son due to his unmarried status to Schreiber being considered only a sperm donor. He sued for parental rights but lost the case.</p><p>Patric’s struggle for parental rights led him to lobby the California legislature to recognize parental rights for sperm donors. His efforts paid off in 2014, when a court legally recognized him as the father of his son.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2wKymp2WglsGztcJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kelly-clarkson-narvel-blackstocks-lawsuit-to-end-in-fall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelly Clarkson, Narvel Blackstock's Lawsuit to End in Fall">&larr;
