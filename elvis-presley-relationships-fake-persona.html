Despite that, it turns out that many Presley fans don't know some facts about him, including that, according to Priscilla, <a href=#>he did horrible things</a> and <a href=#>almost joined a cult</a>.</p><p>Many of Presley's fans also don't know some fascinating facts about his love life, including <a href=#>whether he had an affair with June Carter Cash</a>. One of the most amazing mostly unknown facts about Presley's love life is that he used a fake persona to pick up women.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>why Elvis Presley reportedly used a fake persona to seduce women</strong>. Then, this article will look at <strong>how Presley reportedly began his relationship with his ex-wife</strong>, Priscilla Presley.</p><h2 id=elvis-presley-put-on-a-quot-country-boy-act-quot-to-pick-up-women-according-to-his-longtime-bodyguard>Elvis Presley Put On A "Country Boy Act" To Pick Up Women According To His Longtime Bodyguard</h2><p>Since Elvis Presley is a true music legend, generations of fans have obsessed over every aspect of his life. In fact, fans are so curious about Presley that his former longtime bodyguard, Red West, became famous mostly due to his association with the rock star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Presley's father fired several members of the singer's entourage, including his bodyguard, West wrote a book about his former boss. That book, which was entitled "Elvis: What Happened", contained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many fascinating facts about the rock star</a>. Arguably the most interesting passage from the book is when West wrote about <strong>Presley adopting a persona to pick up women</strong>.</p><p>“He really developed that professional country-boy act with women. In the later years it was no longer natural, it became his line.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/elvis-presley.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As West revealed later in his book, the reason why Presley had to put on the persona around women as time went on is his personality changed. After several years of having women interested in him, <strong>Presley wasn't nervous around women anymore</strong>.</p><p>“It was pretty funny, but at the time I thought, heck, man, old Elvis is starting to lose his shyness. Elvis then started to relax a lot more when there were gals around.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elvis-presley-s-disturbing-rant-at-a-concert-left-his-backup-singers-so-upset-they-walked-out-on-him.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Elvis Presley's Disturbing Rant At A Concert Left His Backup Singers So Upset They Walked Out On Him</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Elvis Presley is a music icon but he could be a jerk including the night he was so bad that his backup singer walked out on him.</span><p>According to West, Presley's views on his relationships with women evolved a lot over the years. In his book, West revealed that it wasn't until the mid-'50s that Presley realized women were interested in him too.</p><p>How long did Elvis Presley live, according to Britannica?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Elvis Presley born?:</p></td><td><p>January 8, 1935</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Elvis Presley born?:</p></td><td><p>Tupelo, Mississippi</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When did Elvis Presley die?:</p></td><td><p>August 16, 1977</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old was Elvis Presley when he died?:</p></td><td><p>42 years, 7 months, and 8 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/elvis-presley-s-forgotten-girlfriend-sheila-marie-ryan-was-the-inspiration-behind-his-best-song-commons-licences.jpg><p>For full context, Presley released several songs that became huge hits in 1956. Most notably, Presley's songs "Don't Be Cruel" and "Hound Dog" both became huge hits in 1956. That was only a year after <strong>the singer realized women were attracted to him</strong>, according to West.</p><p>“Toward the end of 1955, and Elvis suddenly found that he was one helluv an attractive guy off stage as well as on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-Elvis-Presley-Got-Away-With-Dating-Priscilla-When-She-Was-Just-14-copy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Elvis Would've Made An Absolute Fortune Had He Been Allowed To Tour Overseas</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While Elvis Presley was extremely rich, he would have made so much money if his closest business associate allowed him to tour overseas.</span><p>Around the same time that Presley understood women were attracted to him, he realized something else. According to West, Presley realized in 1955 that women enjoyed being intimate as much as men do.</p><p>“And he started to realize that women liked going to bed just as much as men did."</p><p>West then went on to reveal an anecdote about what it was like to pick up women with Presley. "One day in Memphis we were just cruising around in the pink Crown Victoria and we just came across two gals. I guess we knew them vaguely. They were more pick-ups than anything else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/footage-of-elvis-presley-s-last-performance-was-kept-private-long-after-his-death-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In West's book, Presley's former bodyguard revealed how the singer's lifestyle changed once he understood women more.</p><p><strong>Who did Elvis Presley date, according to Pop Sugar?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>June Juanico (1955-1956)</strong></li><li><strong>Natalie Wood (1956)</strong></li><li><strong>Rita Moreno (1950s)</strong></li><li><strong>Anita Wood (1957-1962)</strong></li><li><strong>Priscilla Presley (1959-1973)</strong></li><li><strong>Connie Stevens (1960s)</strong></li><li><strong>Anne Helm (1961)</strong></li><li><strong>Ann-Margret (1964)</strong></li><li><strong>Barbara Leigh (1970-1972)</strong></li><li><strong>Cybill Shepherd (1972)</strong></li><li><strong>Peggy Lipton (Early 1970s)</strong></li><li><strong>Peggy Lipton (Early 1970s)</strong></li><li><strong>Sheila Ryan (1973-1975)</strong></li><li><strong>Ginger Alden (1976-1977)</strong></li></ul><p>According to West, once Presley knew that women wanted to be with him, there were times <strong>his entourage had women coming and going all day long</strong>.</p><p>“Like everything, when Elvis does something, he goes all the way.
