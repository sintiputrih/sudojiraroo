"Josh Schwartz produced both shows and literally the first time we met, that whole cast was eating at Canter's and I lived at Canter's for like my entire 20s," he told Faris, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1253676/youll-swoon-hearing-adam-brody-reveal-what-he-loves-most-about-leighton-meester data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=E! class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">E!</a> "And I was leaving, and he introduced all of us."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two had brief encounters with each other in the years that followed. Eventually, they were both cast in the 2011 film The Oranges. "We did this movie together. I was seeing someone at the time," Brody said. "So we met kind of through mutual work friends off and on. And then we didn't get together about a year after that movie, when I was single."</p><img alt="new york, ny june 08 leighton meester l and husband adam brody attend the american theatre wings 68th annual tony awards at radio city music hall on june 8, 2014 in new york city photo by d dipasupilfilmmagic" title="American Theatre Wing&amp;apos;s 68th Annual Tony Awards - Arrivals" width=1996 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-450328376-1617118272.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">D Dipasupil</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Leighton Meester and Adam Brody attend the 2014 Tony Awards in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though he didn't make any moves while they were costars, Brody revealed, "I was very attracted to her from jump. She's a heavenly creature. I thought she was gorgeous. And even when we did the movie, there was chemistry there, but I was seeing someone."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the chemistry, he still wasn't sure about Meester's personality. "But I had no idea whether she was a good person or not. And, in fact, kind of assumed she probably wasn't for like the first handful of years that I didn't know her, just because, I don't know, Gossip Girl," he said. "Not that I tagged all actresses with that or anything—I didn't. And I like to date actors. I never believe that stigma."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He began to realize how wrong his initial impression was once they started dating. "And I was like, 'Oh, she's cool.' But I still didn't know, and that continued even to when we first started dating," he continued to explain to Faris. "And come to find out she's literally like Joan of Arc. She is the strongest, best person I know. She is my moral compass and North Star, and I just can't say enough good things about her character. It's crazy."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her moral compass extends to just about everybody, Brody revealed, except for one particular demographic. "She's never been rude to like a single person in her life, except—and I give her credit for this—paparazzi, where I'm too self-conscious," the actor said. "I wouldn't say rude but like people will try to get her to sign some sexy old photo or something that aren't fans but they pretend to be fans ... It's sort of a bottom feeding thing ... She has no problem being like, 'You can hate me. I don't care.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brody and Meester married in 2014.
