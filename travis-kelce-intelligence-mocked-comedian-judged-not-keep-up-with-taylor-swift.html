She referred to their coupling as "unlikely" but also revealed that it's for this reason that so many people have shown their support for the couple. "It just makes sense. We're obsessed," she added. <a href=#>Kelce has also made self-deprecating jokes</a> about himself before.</p><p><strong>Swift's relationship history is well-known; in the past, she has appeared to fall hard for her partners (and her relationships have inspired her songwriting). Oshry also commented on this, saying how this new coupling with Kelce provides a "lightness" compared to Swift's past</strong>. She joked, "He's just, like, an American meathead."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel like she's at a point in her life where she should just be able to have fun and enjoy the fruits of her labor and be able to, like, just go out to a restaurant with her boyfriend and not, like, worry, 'What does he think about this?' Like, he's not thinking about this! He likes the meal!" she told Page Six.</p><h2 id=what-has-travis-kelce-said-about-his-relationship-with-taylor-swift>What Has Travis Kelce Said About His Relationship With Taylor Swift?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-5.jpg><p><strong>Oshry is a comedian, so what she says about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift should not be taken too seriously. What is serious, though, is their relationship</strong>. There have been many reports about how they are <a href=#>already thinking about having babies</a> and have shown their support for each other. This includes <a href=#>Kelce's plans to travel to Europe to support Swift's Eras tour</a>. "Oh, you know I gotta go support," he told Entertainment Tonight in an interview in April 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We are both very career-driven.

Photos from the event were shared on Instagram, and fans have a lot to say about their achievements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan commented on the photos, writing, "Remembering that Travis is technically more educated than Taylor is insane." Another also weighed in on the comparisons between Travis and Swift. "Man, I get tired of people thinking he's famous because of his girlfriend. Sheesh.
