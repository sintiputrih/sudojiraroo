"She's very family oriented, and I ... I love my family and my friends. She's the same way."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Eva Longoria, Tony Parker.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L. Cohen/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They soon began dating, and after a brief split in September 2006, they got engaged two months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>They were each other’s biggest cheerleaders. Tony might not have known anything about Desperate Housewives before meeting Eva, but he quickly learned and accompanied her on the red carpet during award season every year.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eva, for her part, took her support for Tony a step further — and while she was already a Spurs fan and often spotted in the stands, she tattooed his jersey number (nine) on the back of her neck. The tattoo — along with two others — were removed following their split in 2010, and former President Obama even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>called Eva out</a> for getting the ink in the first place.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now was that a good idea?" Eva said Obama jokingly asked her about a tattoo denoting her and Parker's wedding date on her wrist when she joined him on the 2012 campaign trail.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>On their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wedding day</a>: 7/7/07.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a fairy tale come to life when Eva and Tony wed in front of 200 guests at the Church of Saint-Germain L'Auxerrois (across the street from the Louvre) in Paris. Eva wore a custom mermaid gown with a dramatic train by designer Angel Sanchez, and the couple exchanged diamond-encrusted Piaget rings during the lavish ceremony.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Eva Longoria, Tony Parker.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterwards, the reception was hosted in a 17th-century castle, Château Vaux le Vicomte, in the French countryside, with the evening capped off by a private fireworks show.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>Three years into their marriage, Eva filed for divorce from Tony in November 2010, citing irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The morning the news broke, Eva tweeted to her fans: “It is with great sadness that after 7 years together, Tony and I have decided to divorce. We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness." She added no other details at the time, but later revealed that they split after she found out Tony was having an affair (it was reported that he was cheating with former NBA player Brent Barry’s wife, a claim that both Parker and Barry have denied).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Longoria discussed how the cheating scandal took a toll on her self-esteem while appearing on the Lifetime series <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet</a>. “It wasn’t about who he chose. I mean, I had moments of, ‘Am I not sexy enough? Am I not pretty enough? Am I not smart enough?'” Longoria said. “But in so many of those questions, I immediately stopped and said, ‘No, don’t start doing that.’ Because you can get stuck in that cycle.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Actress Eva Longoria Parker (R) and Tony Parker attend the 15th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards cocktail party held at the Shrine Auditorium on January 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “Society usually thinks there’s something wrong with the woman. ‘Oh, he cheated on her, so she must not have been sexually satisfying him. She must have been a ball and chain!'” says Longoria. “Why did he have to have a reason to cheat that had to do with me? … I am so secure in who I am. I really am! And I’m not conceited. I just think, ‘Wow, okay, that’s the life you want to live.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three years later, Tony shared the heartache he experienced during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hello! Magazine</a>. “It was a difficult and painful experience in my life,” he said. “It's not easy to leave a relationship, because when I get involved in something, I want to do well.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker added that the media attention revolving around the scandal only made the situation worse. “The exposure, I could not control. This is the world we live in today; everything is on the Internet and on social network sites,” he explained. “I never paid attention to what people said. Hollywood is another world, on another level."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>After staying single for two years following her divorce from Parker, Longoria found love again with her current husband, Mexican businessman José Bastón. They were introduced by a mutual friend in 2013, but they didn't start dating until they were reintroduced months later. Longoria and Bastón got married in 2016 and welcomed their first child together, a son named Santiago Enrique on June 19, 2018. Eva is also a stepmom to José's other four children from his previous marriage.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Eva Longoria, Tony Parker.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Serge BENHAMOU/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the Desperate Housewives series finale in 2012, Eva moved on to other TV acting gigs — including guest-starring roles in Telenovela, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Empire. Meanwhile, her most recent project, Tell It Like a Woman, was nominated for an Oscar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker went on to marry French journalist Axelle Francine in 2014, and welcomed a son, Josh that same year. They divorced in 2020, and Parker is now in a relationship with French tennis star Alizé Lim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2019, Parker announced his retirement from the NBA. Throughout his 18-year-long career, he won four NBA championships, and became the first Frenchman to enter the legendary NBA Hall of Fame. Today, Parker is an ambassador for the Newrest Group, a multi-sector catering company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZp2mlnqtu82gpquhkWLBsLrYZqeaqpuav26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mbm1wZWyDcQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rehab-addict-bobby-prothero-and-wife-karin-have-two-kids-as-they-struggle-with-the-tragedy-of-losing-their-daughter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rehab Addict Bobby Prothero and Wife Karin Have Two Kids As They Struggle With The Tragedy Of ">&larr;
