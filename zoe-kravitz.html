Source: Entertainment Wise</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Zoe is a multi-talented star with acting and singing skills. She has numerous amount of movies in her career. Here are some of the highlights of her career. In an industry that rarely shows black women as anything but, in Zoe’s words, “best friend of the white girl”, Kravitz works hard to give weight to her flimsy blockbuster roles. She says in an interview with The Guardian:</p><p>“I ask writers and producers: ‘Why don’t you have any black people in your film?’, ‘Why do stories happen to white people and everyone else is a punchline?’ What I’m finding is that a lot of people don’t see it’s an issue because it’s not their story, unless they’re black or a minority.”</p><p>Zoë Kravitz is also very vocal about the racial discrimination that she faces in the industry. Regarding this issue, she says:</p><p>“There are certain roles where I know what they are asking for. They want me to talk like I’m not an educated person. But if my character’s not educated, you have to tell me why. It can’t just be because I’m black.”</p><p>She also talks about what a good piece of art looks like. “Art should be offensive to an extent. That’s what gets a reaction out of people; someone’s opinion that’s different from yours. It’s amazing to me that no one takes the time to try and see what someone’s trying to say because they’d rather just post an inane comment. They’re missing out on good art.” She goes on:</p><p>I think a lot of films now are really, really boring because no one’s willing to offend anyone. Everything’s become so PC. If you watch any movie that was made before the mid-90s, there are things that are being said and done that no one would dare do now, because they’d get criticised on a blog.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-29660 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Zoë-Kravitz-in-a-movie-scene.jpg alt="Zoë Kravitz" width=650 height=328 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-29660 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Zoë Kravitz in a scene from the 2016 movie Vincent-N-Roxxy.

She also has a voice in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 2017 and The Lego Batman Movie in 2018.</p><p>Another one is Dope, a 2015 comedy-crime movie. The film wowed critics at the Sundance Film Festival by riffing on the stereotypes that Zoe has fallen victim to. It was written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa and stars newcomer, Shameik Moore as Malcolm, a geeky black teenager trying to navigate the rougher areas of the Californian city of Inglewood without gang members stealing his vintage Nike Airs or touching his hi-top haircut.</p><p>Zoe Kravitz’s character in this film is Nakia. She is the symbol of the film’s issues. She’s a checklist hottie, bounced between her gangland beau, which is played by rapper A$AP Rocky, and bumbling, nebbish Malcolm. Nakia has smarts, but no wit; looks, but no sex appeal. She’s a sexy behavior stereotype in a film that makes a big deal of being seen to subvert them.

She was cast as a goth babysitter in the Catherine Zeta-Jones rom-com No Reservations. As the then-teenager, she couldn’t go on set until her designated guardian had signed in.</p><p>But Lenny Kravitz came late, and when he arrived, the rockstar caused such a stir that the delays simmered on. The film’s director, Scott Hicks, was not aware when he cast her that Zoë was Lenny’s daughter. Scott wasn’t expecting the fuss. So Zoë took control. “She told her dad off,” says Hicks. “He wasn’t late again.”</p><p>Zoe was involved in controversy after Lily Allen wrote that both kissed in her autobiography.
