He and his family resided in the United States.&nbsp;He spent some time in Vancouver, Canada. Later, he returned to Las Vegas, Nevada, in the United States, for work. Prior to his death, he was living in Nairobi, Kenya with his family. He was just 34 years old (at the time of his death).&nbsp;He received his primary education in a local school in his country. He was a well-educated guy who earned his bachelor’s degree from a prestigious institution. Let me introduce you to Alex Nderi, his true name. After his occupation, he changed his name to ‘DJ Lithium.’ He said that he picked the term ‘Lithium’ since he enjoyed chemistry in school.</p><h2>DJ Lithium Height & Weight</h2><p><b>DJ Lithium is 5 feet 7 inches tall</b><span>. He weighs approximately 62 kg. He has lovely warm black eyes and bald locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, and so on.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DJ-Lithium-1.jpg><h2>DJ Lithium Net Worth</h2><p><b>How much is DJ Lithium’s net worth?&nbsp; </b>He had a plethora of laptops, PCs, and recording gear for music creation. His earnings were from his songs, businesses, live events, and marketing. His net worth was believed to be between USD 2-3 million (approx.).</p><h2>Career</h2><p>DJ Lithium was a well-known dick jockey, music producer, and businessman. According to his official website, he co-founded the music production firm ‘Black Tiger Recordings’ with his colleague Earl Von Bye. Lithium was primarily concerned in creating unique music for the public and its supporters.&nbsp;Alex Nderi reportedly worked in the music business for two decades. He came to prominence in 2014 with the publication of his EP named ‘Hellspeak’ in the spring of that year. His other remix music includes Reload, Harvest Moon, Day By Day, Approach Vector, Zero Hour, The Equation, and many more.</p><p>I’d like to point out that DJ Lithium was also the proprietor of the ‘Blue Soho Recordings label group.’ Through his own company, he recorded hundreds of successful tunes. His tracks may be found on a variety of music streaming services, including Amazon, SoundCloud, Reverbnation.com, iTunes, Juno, Spotify, Hungama, and many more.</p><h2>DJ Lithium Death</h2><p>Alex Nderi went through a lot of troubles, but he never shared them with any of his friends.

He left a letter on his desk stating that he committed himself due to family troubles.&nbsp;He erased all of his social media accounts and messaged his friends and family that he was leaving. Later, he went to the bathroom and ingested dangerous poison. He collapsed as he returned to his workstation. He died when he arrived at the Nairobi hospital.</p><h2>DJ Lithium Girlfriend & Dating</h2><p><b>Who is DJ Lithium dating?&nbsp;</b>DJ Lithium was an extremely private individual who never revealed anything about his personal life. According to certain online sites, he was married, but the identity of his spouse remains unknown. Similarly, we are unable to offer a photograph of his wife due to a lack of facts and information.&nbsp;According to reports, he did not reveal information about his children. It’s also conceivable that he doesn’t have any children.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibo2WcnsGptdSmZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./does-harrison-bader-have-brother-meet-sister-sasha-bader.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Harrison Bader Have Brother?
