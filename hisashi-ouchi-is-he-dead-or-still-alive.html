They were accused of unsafe transfer practices and the use of outdated equipment.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Above all, the employees were never provided any training to handle any unforeseen events or critical work-related emergencies.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>On the date of the ill-fated incident, Hisashi Ouchi was performing the task of pouring a mixture of uranyl nitrate into a containment tank.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Unfortunately, that tank was not well equipped to handle the amount of radioactive material that it was supposed to handle. Ultimately, the tank reached its point of critical mass and the nuclear fission chain reaction was started.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hisashi Ouchi was performing the task and a large portion of his body was directly extended on the tank.

His skin started sweltering and pieces of his flesh started falling off in front of doctors.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Fluids were pouring out from the places where the skin had fallen off. Blood was pouring out even from his eyes and it felt as if he was crying blood.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He was drained of all his body fluids in a single day.
