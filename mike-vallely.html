Skating with a local team called “Subculture”, in the Kempsville area of Virginia Beach, Vallely tested his street skills in local contests, as well as on neighborhood quarter-pipe and launch ramps. In the spring of 1986, the Virginia Beach Skate park, Mount Trashmore, hosted a professional vert skateboard contest. Vallely and his friend began skating in the car park, adjacent to the vert ramp, during practice, and drew the attention of professional skateboarder, Neil Blender, from atop the ramp. Lance Mountain and Stacy Peralta, both of Powell Peralta and the Bones Brigade, were also impressed with Vallely. Seeing Vallely skate on a worn board, Mountain provided him with a brand new skateboard. Following the impromptu demo, Peralta offered Vallely an amateur sponsorship deal with Powell-Peralta Skateboards.</p><h2>Mike Vallely Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mike Vallely is one of the <strong>richest Skateboarder</strong> from United States.

In July 1986, Vallely’s new sponsor flew him to California to compete at the “Street Attack” contest, in Oceanside, California. Vallely won the amateur division, which led to a full-page spread in Transworld Skateboarding’s September issue. Also in 1986, Vallely appeared in the third Powell-Peralta video, The Search for Animal Chin, which was released in 1987. Later that year, Vallely became a professional skateboarder at a vert contest in Toronto, Canada on May 31, 1987.</p><p>At the age of seventeen, Vallely watched a television program about endangered African elephants which impacted and made him reflect on the harm that humans do to other species. This led him to become a vegetarian and subsequently vegan. His 1988 debut skateboard model had an African elephant as the artwork, because he wanted “to remind people” of them. His third signature model skateboard, 1989’s “The Barnyard”, had emblazoned the words “Please Don’t Eat My Friends” and was one of the firsts models that promoted vegetarianism. Vallely’s vocal opinions on this subject were typically met with derision by both skaters and promoters. In 1999, he and his family abandoned this lifestyle. He later stated that this decision was partly due to compromising himself to please his sponsors and that he felt “lost” for the next fifteen years.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mike Vallely height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Mike <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Vallely joined a band called Resistance in 1985, although he only played one live show with the group, in which the bands 7 Seconds and Aggression also played. Vallely was asked to leave the band for spending too much time on skateboarding. In 2003, Greg Ginn invited Vallely to sing for Black Flag at its 2003 reunion shows in Los Angeles, where he performed the entire My War album. Vallely was the lead singer for Mike V and the Rats, and the band’s song, “The Days”, appeared in the video game, Tony Hawk’s Underground (THUG), and their song, “Never Give Up”, appeared in THUG’s successor, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2. In 2013, Vallely formed a band called Good For You with Greg Ginn. Their debut album was released on SST Records in February 2013. In November 2013 during a Black Flag show in Australia, singer Ron Reyes was fired mid-show by the band with Vallely doing the duties of informing him and replaced him on vocals for the remainder of the show. Reyes said that his mic was taken and he was told to get off the stage by musician Vallely. “You’re done, party’s over get off it’s over…” He said something else to me but it was a lie so I won’t repeat it here. So with a sense of great relief that it was finally over I left the stage and walked to the hotel room. They finished the set with Mike V on vocals.”In January 2014, founding member Greg Ginn announced Mike Vallely would be the new lead singer of Black Flag.

World Industries created the second ever double-kick skateboard design (a skateboard deck with a kicktail at both ends). The first was the Vision Double Tail, which Vallely’s double kick was modeled after but with a mellower kick and shorter tail than nose which would become the industry standard.
