Take for example General Hospital’s Alexis, who hasn’t had the best track record with men. Her long-time, on-again, off-again romance with Julian ended with him holding a knife to her throat, though that was forced upon him by his crazy sister Olivia. Of course, Alexis also drunkenly ran Julian down. Though the couple was fan favorites, Alexis moved on and found what she felt was her first real adult relationship with psychiatrist Neil Burns. Sadly he was murdered by her crazed friend Harmony, and Julian died after a confrontation with Sonny on a bridge and being shot by one of Cyrus’ men. Off-screen, Alexis’ portrayer Nancy Lee Grahn has found real love with Richard Smith, a music professor at USC and professional jazz guitarist.</p><p>Lately, unluck-in-love Alexis has found herself in many squabbles over journalistic ethics with history and journalism professor Gregory Chase, father to Dr. Hamilton Finn and former Detective Harrison Chase. They’ve begun working closely on a number of articles following the Port Charles’ hook killer, and it’s obvious these two are destined to become something more. In real life, Gregory’s portrayer Gregory Harrison has been married to his wife former actress and model Randi Oakes since 1980. She’s probably best known as Officer Bonnie Clark on the television series CHiPs. Harrison is himself a well-versed actor, starring in popular shows such as Trapper John, M.D., Falcon Crest, and Chesapeake Shores.&nbsp;The couple has four children together: Lily Anne, Quinn Edgar, Kate and Emma Lee.</p><p>Poor Brad has had a rough couple of years. He recently lost his best friend Britt. Before that, he spent time in prison for his part in swapping Nelle and Michael’s baby with Willow and Shiloh’s, a crime that cost him his husband Lucas. However, no matter what crimes Brad commits, he tends to win over the audience with his hilarious antics, such as accidentally making a viral video of his BFF Britt getting knocked into the Metro Court pool by a parachuting Cody. Apparently Brad’s portrayer Parry Shen is just as hilarious on-screen as he is off-screen. Take for instance his and his wife Kim Hollands’ outrageous costumes for parties. Parry’s been married to Kim, a fourth-grade teacher since 2002 and they share two daughters.</p><p>As for Brad’s late friend Britt, aka “The Britch,” her portrayer Kelly Thiebaud is currently living her best life in London. <a href=# rel=noopener>Thiebaud recently revealed the main reason for leaving</a> the show was that she’s been involved in a long-distance relationship with her new beau across the pond for a year now, and the separation has been hard. We wish her all the luck in the world, and knowing this is a soap, we wouldn’t be surprised if Victor put her character Britt in a cryogenic state to later bring her back to life to impress her mother and the woman he’s obsessed with, Dr. Liesl Obrecht.</p><p><strong>For more gorgeous photos of the stars and their loves browse our recently updated gallery of <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital actors and actresses with their real-life partners</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvNnq6sZ2VsfXKBlGienqaVp66teceoqqmhpJa5bq3Craarq12nsqK4jKWgn51dpa6zwM2eqaxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-tim-burton-making-a-new-movie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Tim Burton making a new movie?">&larr;
