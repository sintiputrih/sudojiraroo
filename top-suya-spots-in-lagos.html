No doubt, Suya is very tasty and much savoured by Nigerians from all walks of life. Its ‘evolution’ has been pretty amazing. From the roadside sweaty Mallam standing beside charcoal-powered, fire like one rehearsing how to stand the heat in hell, to posh spots where lovers and family can sit and savour every hot, tantalizing piece of well-peppered meat. Choi!?</p><p>Suya is not as healthy as we think it is. However, to guard against dangers when savouring this dish, you might want to check this post on how best to prevent yourself and eliminate deadly risks associated with Suya.</p><p>Suya, though, originated in the Northern parts of Nigeria, it has permeated the Nigerian society, being affordable for all and available everywhere. It has been called a unifying factor in Nigeria.</p><p>It is why we have taken the time to compile this list on some of the best Suya spots in Lagos, just in case you are thinking of unwinding with this super food. Hold your breath, suspend your nose and visualize a scintillating double paged newspaper filled with Suya and accompaniments before you, like the Biblical table before David in the presence of his enemies. Lordy Lord! ?

There is wheelchair accessible parking which is very limited. The Entrance has a small wheelchair ramp. The suya here is famous! Each skewer of suya is between N300-N500 upwards.

This is probably one of the oldest Suya spots in Lagos if not the oldest, with over 40 years of active operation! Popularly referred to ‘Suya Spot Akerele’, this Surulere boasts of one of the tastiest and spiciest suya in Lagos. It has branches scattered all around Lagos; Akerele Street, Surulere and Mega Plaza, Victoria Island are the most prominent ones. The suya here is a bit pricy but its taste is topnotch</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> Akerele St, Surulere, Lagos</p><p><strong>Opening Time:</strong> 12:00 PM – 11:00 PM (Mondays – Sundays)</p><ul><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cdd-suya-spot></span> CDD Suya Spot<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li></ul><p>Located at Ogudu road, CDD Suya Spot comfortably boasts as one of the best suya spots offering true value for money. More often than not, the spot comes alive the most from 6:00 PM till late in the night.&nbsp;It is a very common scenario for car owners to scramble for parking space as there are no structured or designated area as parking lots.</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> 118 Ogudu Rd, Ogudu 100242, Lagos</p><p><strong>Opening Time:</strong> 6:00 PM – 11:00 PM (Mondays – Sundays)</p><ul><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ibb-suya-spot></span> IBB Suya Spot<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li></ul><p>On Display: Masa, Kilishi and Suya at IBB Suya Spot, VI.</p><p>This is one of the best suya and kilishi spots on the island.

Should you decide to try out IBB Suya spot, be sure to try it with the masa!</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos</p><p><strong>Opening Time:</strong> 5:00 PM – 11:00 PM (Mondays – Sundays)</p><ul><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=belton-suya-spot></span> Belton Suya Spot<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li></ul><p>Belton Suya Spot</p><p>Situated in Gbagada, Belton Suya Spot has gizzards, isan (veins), chicken and beef as its options. Beyond the taste and the spiciness of its suya, Belton suya spot is very affordable. As a first time visitor at Belton, you would find out that the suyas are displayed in large quantities which would leave you in doubt whether or not you are buying leftover Suyas from the previous day, only to find out they are suya made on that day. Such is the high demand of Suya at Belton. Many have come to claim that its suya is the best in the gbagada and Pedro area of Lagos mainland. Something worthy of note is that parking spaces are inadequate, so you might want to go prepared if you intend visiting with your vehicle. Oh! the Chicken suya is quite pricy but it would be best you be the judge of that! ?</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> Oguntona Cresent, Pedro, Lagos</p><p><strong>Opening Time:</strong> 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM (Mondays – Sundays)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=notable-mentions-suya-spots-in-lagos></span> Notable Mentions (Suya Spots in Lagos)<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Kaza Grill and Suya Spot</strong> – (Address: Akowonjo, Ikeja).
