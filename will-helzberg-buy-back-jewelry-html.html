Jewelry for both men and women is accepted for exchange. The price of your new jewellery item must be at least twice the cost of your prior jewellery in order to be eligible for the upgrade programme.</p><p></p><h3>There were 34 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Helzberg Diamonds a genuine company?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Everything about this diamond and setting is just as magnificent as anything you’d find at Helzberg (or anywhere for that matter). Another source of my dissatisfaction with Helzberg is brought to light by this. Their Masterpiece diamonds are stunning, but being restricted to the pairings that are presently set is a big disappointment.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Is Helzberg a real estate appraiser?</h3><p>Hisberg is glad to provide one-day appraisal clinics, which provide a complete spectrum of valuation services from an independent, trained jewellery appraiser.

Understand what you’ve got. Decide on a reasonable price. Examine your available possibilities for selling. Prepare yourself emotionally for the sale.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to return jewellery to Zales?</h3><p>When it comes to jewellery, Zales shops will not buy any kind of jewellery; however, they may sometimes accept trade-ins for goods that you have previously bought from Zales. A second option is to use Zales’ online Gold Exchange, which allows you to sell gold or platinum without having to worry about whether the metal contains any diamonds or precious jewels.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Do you have the ability to return diamonds?</h3><p>Please return the diamond. If nothing else seems to work for you, you may be able to return your diamond and get a refund for your investment. However, this is dependent on the return policy that was offered with the stone when it was purchased. It is possible that you may not be able to return your diamond in certain cases.</p><p></p><h3>Helzberg’s diamonds are sourced from a variety of sources.</h3><p>Learn more about the process of creating lab-grown diamonds. Natural diamonds at Helzberg are responsibly mined from deep inside the earth’s mantle, according to the company. It is because they are very uncommon that they are a little more costly than lab-grown diamonds. Besides that, we at Helzberg adhere to the Kimberley Process, which guarantees that our diamonds are always conflict-free.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the best way to sell my ring?</h3><p>Here’s How to Make Your Engagement Ring Setting Sell Like Crazy. Recognize that you will not make a profit on your purchase, particularly if it is a custom-made setup. Do not browse at local jewellery stores or pawn shops. Abe Mor is the greatest place to shop for used diamonds and ring settings since they have the best pricing. If you have gold or platinum, you may sell it for scrap metal.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to receive a refund for an engagement ring?</h3><p>An engagement ring is a significant investment, and consumers are interested in learning about the item’s history. In order to avoid this, most jewellery retailers will not offer you a complete refund if you attempt to return an item to them. In reality, some businesses have a rigorous “no-return” policy that they will not tolerate.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to get my ring cleaned at any jewellery store?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Yes, this is correct! Almost every jeweller and jewellery store in the country will clean and polish your jewellery as a courtesy and at no additional cost to you! Most jewellers and salespeople will instinctively inquire as to whether or not you would need your rings cleaned.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is there a layaway programme at Helzberg Diamonds?</h3><p>A down payment of 10% of your total purchase must be made to the layaway department of Helzberg Diamonds in order to open a layaway account with them. In addition, you may make payments in any Helzberg shop at any time of day.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3>What is the approximate cost of resizing a ring?</h3><p>A jeweller may do the task in as little as two hours, however it might take up to a month if the ring has an ornate setting. A basic resizing ranges in price from $20 to $60, depending on the kind of metal used and the location of the nation where it is performed. More extensive resizing might cost anything from $50 to $150 per square foot.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Does Helzberg invest in gold?</h3><p>Helzberg Jewelers has lately launched a gold purchasing programme dubbed the “Helzberg Diamonds gold purchase programme” (despite the fact that their official jewellery shop name is “Helzberg Diamonds,” they are not really purchasing diamonds via this programme). Helzberg has been in operation for more than 104 years.</p><p></p><h3>What is the average time it takes to resize a ring?</h3><p>As little as 10 minutes might pass between the commencement of the ring’s resizing operation and its completion by the jeweler’s technicians. Downsizing, on the other hand, may take longer depending on the ring design, stone settings, and material used.</p><p></p><h3>Is it preferable to pawn or sell jewels in this situation?</h3><p>If you decide to pawn your ring, you may be able to obtain a greater monetary offer for it as a result. If you sell an item to a pawn shop, they must resell it to make a profit. Furthermore, since they are not earning any money from you in the form of interest and fees when you sell the ring, it is a little riskier for them than if you had pawned the ring.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>LTD was established in 2022.
